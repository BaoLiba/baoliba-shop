It has become fashionable in Nigeria to promote brands on Tumblr, especially by bloggers from the North, along with the rise in tactful, creative marketing strategies.


Young Nigerians are flocking to Tumblr for its authenticity and unfettered creativity after Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok became mainstream with corporate mercenarism. South African brands are now increasingly turning to Tumblr influencers to gain premium exposure in the Nigerian market.


This article examines the pricing structure for marketing with Tumblr influencers in Nigeria to give South African brands the edge over their competitors.

## üì¢ Tumblr marketing in Nigeria

Tumblr has become a hub of youth creativity in Nigeria, especially among Muslim youth from the Northern region.

Despite being a predominantly Islamic region, Northern Nigeria has become a hotspot for creative expression with strange art and designs depicting nudity, sex, drug abuse, violence, etc.

Designers, musicians, artists, photographers, poets, etc. have adopted the platform for marketing and promoting their creative talents.


This is why many South African brands have opted to promote their products with Northern Nigerian Tumblr influencers rather than those from the Southern region.

According to Mark Angel, Social Media Manager at Brand Video Hub, ‚ÄúWe use Tumblr bloggers from the Northern region of Nigeria to market our clients‚Äô brands because their content generate more leads than that of their Southern counterparts.‚Äù


Tumblr‚Äôs free-spirited culture allows for more creative, edgier marketing tactics that resonate with Nigerian youth. This is why Tumblr influencers are preferred over those on Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok.

## üìä Marketing expenses of Tumblr influencers in Nigeria

The cost of marketing with a Nigerian Tumblr influencer depends on several factors that determine the influencer‚Äôs audience engagement level and reach.


1. **Duration of visibility of the brand on the influencer‚Äôs blog**: Normally, a minimum of 1 week is required before a brand can audibly be heard on the influencer‚Äôs interaction page, this will cost between 2,000 and 7,500 Naira.

2. **Promotion of the brand on the influencer‚Äôs dashboard or homepage**:  With the right keywords, a brand can gain more visibility on Tumblr‚Äôs search engines and on the blogs of other influencers. This service will cost between 3,500 and 10,000 Naira.

3. **Posting photos and videos of the brand on the influencer‚Äôs blog**: This ensures that the influencer‚Äôs audience or followers are constantly reminded of the brand. This service will cost between 10,000 and 20,000 Naira.

4. **Creation of original content for the brand**: If a brand does not have sufficient material for promotion, creating original content will cost between 10,000 and 40,000 Naira.

5. **Creation of memes for the brand**: Memes are very popular on Tumblr, and brands can create more engagement with memes. Meme creation costs between 2,000 and 10,000 Naira.

6. **Advertising the brand on other platforms**: This includes posting links to the brands‚Äô blogs on WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, and engaging followers to visit the brands‚Äô blogs. This service costs between 3,000 and 10,000 Naira.

7. **Communicating with potential customers on behalf of the brand**: Being influential means having many followers, which makes it hard to attend to every inquiry. Therefore, a brand may need the influencer to attend to queries for it, and this will cost between 3,000 and 10,000 Naira.


**NOTE**: all these prices are usually negotiable due to the bargaining nature of Nigerians. It is also likely that South African brands will pay 10% less than Nigerian brands for the same service.

## üìà Audience engagement vs reach

The difference between audience engagement and reach must always be taken into consideration to determine the right Nigerian Tumblr influencer for a South African brand.

As already stated, many Northern Nigerian Muslim youth are adopting Tumblr for creative expression, but not all of them are influencers.

Similarly, those classified as influencers differ in the level of audience engagement and reach which are determined by the number of followers and the amount of likes, reblogs, captions, etc.

An influencer having up to 100,000 followers with poor engagement may have a better audience reach than an influencer with 50,000 followers but high engagement.

This is because the latter‚Äôs followers may be less likely to reblog or like posts, which reduces the influencer‚Äôs reach, but they may be more likely to engage with captions.

This is why it‚Äôs important to check both the engagement and reach of a Nigerian Tumblr influencer before hiring them for marketing. Using engagement or reach alone could yield poor results.

## ‚ùó Payment methods

Once a South African brand has hired a Nigerian Tumblr influencer for marketing, payments must be made on time, just like it is done in South Africa.

However, South African brands must be mindful of the payment methods, as some payment methods are illegal in Nigeria.

For example, Western Union and MoneyGram are illegal in Nigeria because the dollar is no longer sold over the counter. Therefore, they are no longer accepted as payment methods by Nigerian Tumblr influencers.

Also, PayPal is not usable in Nigeria. The majority of African countries, including South Africa, are able to use PayPal. However, Nigeria has been blacklisted.

Therefore, South African brands must rely on the traditional bank wire transfer methods which is legal and universal.


1. **Naira Account**: Payments can be made into the influencer‚Äôs local currency account in Naira, but usually incurs heavy fees and takes a longer time.

2. **Dollar Account**: Payments can be made into the influencer‚Äôs dollar account in Nigeria. This allows direct access to the dollar without needing to convert the dollar into Naira.

It is also important to note that all dollar payments into Nigeria are subject to the CBN $100 rule.

This means that any dollar amount above $10,000 will be subject to rigorous paperwork and scrutiny by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Therefore, it‚Äôs best to keep dollar payments below $10,000.

## üí° Legal considerations

When hiring a Nigerian Tumblr influencer for promotion, South African brands must take into account some legal considerations.

1. **No contracts**: There are no formal contracts binding Nigerian Tumblr influencers. This means that once they are paid for a service, there is nothing to hold them accountable if they default on the service, such as failure to post.

2. **No returns**: Most Nigerian Tumblr influencers, especially the prominent ones, are not willing to return South African brands‚Äô money once they are paid. This is because they have little to no competition within Nigeria.

This makes it best for South African brands to hire influencer marketing agencies that specialize in Nigerian Tumblr influencers.

These agencies will not only find the right influencers for South African brands, but will also take care of payments and ensure that services are rendered. In the end, hiring an agency will cost less than hiring a Nigerian Tumblr influencer directly.
