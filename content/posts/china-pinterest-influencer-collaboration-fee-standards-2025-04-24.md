There are numerous avenues for advertising on Pinterest, and influencer marketing is one of the most effective.

In fact, Pinterest confirms that users have the highest purchase intent of all social platforms, placing Pinterest at the top of all others for social commerce.

This reality opens endless opportunities for influencer partnerships, particularly for brands that target Asian communities, but determining how much will spend on influencer marketing can be a challenge.

Specifically, when it comes to hiring Chinese influencers on Pinterest, South African brands should be prepared for a different pricing structure than what they might expect in their local market.

In this article, we will outline the average rates that Chinese Pinterest influencers charge products and brands, so South African marketers can develop a budget for their campaigns.

## üìä What South African Brands Can Expect to Pay for Ads from Chinese Pinterest Influencers

The price of hiring a Chinese Pinterest influencer to promote a product or brand to South African audiences will vary depending on a number of factors, including:

- The influencer‚Äôs follower count
- The influencer‚Äôs engagement
- The number of posts
- The deliverables required
- The product category

In summary, high-performing Chinese Pinterest influencers will regularly charge South African brands between 1,000 and 20,000 Chinese yuan for a single sponsored post.

To clarify how that encapsulates a range, 1,000 yuan would be the average cost for a novice influencer with low engagement to post on their page.

Conversely, 20,000 yuan would be the average price that a top-tier influencer will charge for several sponsored posts to promote a brand.

In South African Rand (ZAR) currency, that means South African brands can typically expect to spend anywhere from R2,380 to R47,580 for their marketing campaigns.

## üéâ How to Find Chinese Pinterest Influencers for Your Campaign

Despite Pinterest‚Äôs enormous popularity throughout the Asian continent and the world, it is not a primary platform of engagement for South Africans.

While this reality means that South African brands are far less likely to compete for placements with their local market, it also presents a unique challenge.

While influencer marketing is still the best method of advertising on Pinterest, the nature of Pinterest also means that there are fewer influential users.

Additionally, finding relevant influencers across the globe is a time-consuming task, particularly one that is less familiar to South African marketers.

But finding Chinese Pinterest influencers for South African campaigns can be simplified through the use of influencer marketing platforms.

Influencer marketing platforms that specialize in connecting brands with global influencers make it easy for marketers to search for and discover relevant influencers.

Most importantly, they also ensure that the influencers in their database have real, authentic followings.

At BaoLiba, international brands can find a wide range of credible influencers on Pinterest as well as on other popular social media channels.

Most importantly, BaoLiba can connect South African brands with authentic influencers who have dedicated followings throughout the Asian continent.

## üöÄ Why Pinterest Influencers Are Essential for Successful Campaigns

While Pinterest has a lot of unique advantages and engaging features that set it apart from other social platforms, its core function is still primarily visual.

Furthermore, Pinterest has the highest intent of purchases among users of any social media platform and even surpasses other channels of online commerce.

In other words, people who engage with content on Pinterest are there with the express purpose of discovering new products to buy.

For this reason, consumers often rely on peer recommendations to help them sift through the millions of products that are featured on Pinterest.

So, when a product is endorsed by an influential user, it can help audiences feel more confident in their purchase decision.

In short, for Pinterest advertising campaigns, there is no substitute for the power of influencers.

## üîé What Should South African Brands Look for in a Pinterest Influencer

When hiring a Pinterest influencer, South African brands should always consider an influencer‚Äôs engagement over their following. 

A Pinterest influencer with a smaller following but a higher engagement rate will be far more effective in generating conversions than a larger influencer with little-to-no engagement.

Additionally, brands should look for Pinterest influencers that specialize in their niche market.

For example, South African brands that sell beauty products should look for Pinterest influencers who specialize in beauty-related content.

By collaborating with influencers who specialize in niche markets, brands can ensure they reach their target audience with their promotional efforts.

## ‚ùó Hidden Costs of Hiring Pinterest Influencers

When planning a campaign with Pinterest influencers, pricing can often be misleading.

Brands need to clarify with influencers all the costs associated with a campaign to avoid unexpected expenses.

For example, while a Pinterest influencer may charge 1,000 Chinese yuan for a sponsored post, there may be additional costs.

Some of those additional costs can include:

- Influencer fees for analytics and insights
- Sponsored content for multiple platforms
- Fees to share the content across several boards

In short, brands need to be mindful of any hidden costs associated with hiring a Pinterest influencer.

In many instances, influencers will not disclose those additional costs up front and will add them to the final invoice.

## üìÖ How Longer Partnerships Can Reduce Costs for Brands

South African brands that want to begin capitalizing on the power of Pinterest influencers should consider entering into long-term partnerships with them.

While Pinterest influencer costs can add up quickly for individual campaigns, brands can save money by entering into longer partnerships.

In fact, Baoliba reports that brands can save 40% to 50% on influencer marketing campaigns by establishing long-term relationships with influencers.

## üìà Benefits of Longer Partnerships with Pinterest Influencers

Beyond saving money, there are many other benefits for brands that choose to establish long-term partnerships with Pinterest influencers.

Some of the primary benefits of longer relationships with influencers include:

- Consistent engagement: With a longer partnership, brands can ensure consistent engagement from their influencer, which can lead to higher conversions.
- Relatability: Audiences are far more likely to trust a brand that has engaged an influencer for a longer period of time. That relatability can lead to higher conversion rates for brands.
- Stability: Entering into longer partnerships gives brands greater stability for their marketing efforts. This gives them peace of mind and helps them plan their marketing strategies with great efficiency.
