The good news is that Pinterest itself has some built-in tools that will make it easier for brands to find and contact you for a collaboration. 

In this article, we will teach South African Pinterest influencers how to find United States brands to collaborate with, as well as how to promote themselves to grab the attention of those brands.

## üåé Are Pinterest Influencers in South Africa at a Disadvantage?

While it may seem that being a Pinterest influencer in South Africa may put you at a disadvantage when it comes to collaborating with United States brands, that is far from the truth.

In fact, Pinterest is one of the most diverse social media platforms in the world, with users from every corner of the globe. 

Pinterest influencers in South Africa can leverage the platform‚Äôs built-in tools that connect them with brands, just like Pinterest influencers from any other country.

The best thing about Pinterest is that it allows brands to reach their target audiences without geographical limitations.

This means that a United States clothing brand can find and partner with a fashion influencer from South Africa to market their products to the African continent. 

## üí° Pinterest Tools That Help Influencers Get Noticed By Brands

Pinterest has several tools that brands and influencers can use to increase their visibility on the platform and connect with one another. 

### 1. Pinterest for Creators

Pinterest‚Äôs ‚ÄúFor Creators‚Äù section is a hub of resources and tools to help its influencers monetize their content.

Brands looking for influencers to collaborate with can also visit this part of Pinterest to find content creators for their campaigns.

The ‚ÄúFor Creators‚Äù section has a ‚ÄúGet Discovered‚Äù sub-section where influencers can fill out a form with their information.

The information that Pinterest collects from this form is how Pinterest promotes their profile to brands looking for influencers to partner with.

### 2. Idea Pins

Pinterest‚Äôs Idea Pins are similar to Instagram Reels or TikTok videos. 

These are vertical videos that allow influencers to share multiple clips, images, voiceovers, and other tools that they can use to create unique and compelling content.

Idea Pins are popular on Pinterest, which means that they will also be picked up by Pinterest‚Äôs algorithm, giving more exposure to the influencers that create them.

Creating Idea Pins is also a way for influencers to inform brands of their skills, as well as demonstrate their creativity.

### 3. Pinterest Place

Pinterest Place helps brands and influencers connect with each other based on their geographical locations. 

This tool promotes local content by showing users the Idea Pins that are trending in their area, including their images and videos.

Brands can also use Pinterest Place to find local influencers for their campaigns.

If brands are looking for a South African influencer to promote their products to the South African market, they can browse trending Idea Pins in the region and contact those influencers, if they are interested in collaborating.

## üîç How Pinterest Influencers Can Find United States Brands to Collaborate With

While Pinterest has built-in tools that can help brands find influencers, influencers can also take the initiative to contact brands for potential collaborations.

Here are some tactics that South African Pinterest influencers can use to find United States brands to collaborate with:

### 1. Check Out Popular Idea Pins

One of the best ways for influencers to find brands that they may want to collaborate with is by browsing trending Idea Pins.

They can use the Pinterest search bar to find popular Idea Pins that are related to their niche. 

For example, if you are a fitness influencer, you can type ‚Äúfitness‚Äù into the search bar and view the trending Idea Pins.

If you see any brands that you want to partner with, you can contact them directly and pitch your collaboration idea.

### 2. Search for United States Brands

Pinterest influencers can also enter the name of brands that they want to partner with into the Pinterest search bar.

If a brand is on Pinterest, it will show up in the search results, and influencers can browse their boards and Idea Pins. 

This will give influencers an idea of what the brand is like, what their aesthetic is, and how they interact with their audience.

Once an influencer has taken a look at what a brand is like, they can reach out to that brand and pitch their collaboration idea.

Influencers can also search for hashtags that are related to the brand they are interested in. 

For example, if they want to collaborate with Nike, influencers can search for the hashtag #nike to find branded hashtags that show trending Idea Pins that are related to the brand.

### 3. Use Pinterest Analytics

If Pinterest influencers have a business account, they can use Pinterest Analytics to get insights into their performance on the platform.

Pinterest Analytics also helps influencers understand their audience better. 

This includes where their audience is located, which countries and cities most of their audience comes from, and the average age of their audience.

Pinterest Analytics will also give influencers insights into the keywords that Pinterest users search to find their content. 

If influencers discover that a lot of their audience is from the United States, they may want to contact brands from the United States for potential collaborations.

### 4. Browse Pinterest‚Äôs Business Directory

Pinterest‚Äôs Business Directory showcases brands that are looking for influencers to partner with. 

This directory contains popular brands from various categories and industries, such as fashion, beauty, food, and travel.

Pinterest influencers can browse through Pinterest‚Äôs Business Directory to find brands that align with their niche and contact them for collaborations.

### 5. Try Pinterest Influencer Marketing Platforms

There are also third-party platforms outside of Pinterest that connect influencers with brands looking for partnerships.

Some of these platforms focus on specific niches, which allows brands to find the right influencers for their products and campaigns.

Pinterest influencers can register on these platforms and start contacting brands for potential collaborations.

## üìù How to Promote Yourself as a Pinterest Influencer

Now that we have covered how Pinterest influencers can find brands to partner with, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the best ways that they can promote themselves to brands.

### 1. Keep Your Pinterest Profile Up-To-Date

Pinterest influencers need to ensure that their profiles are up-to-date and accurately reflect their brand. 

This includes using a recognizable profile picture, an eye-catching header image, and an interesting bio that showcases their niche, interests, and skills.

If influencers are using Pinterest for Business, they should also add their website link and social media links to their profiles.

### 2. Create Engaging Content

Content is king on every social media platform, including Pinterest. 

To attract brands, Pinterest influencers need to create engaging content that resonates with their audience.

They need to ensure that their images are high-quality and meet Pinterest‚Äôs size requirements.

Pinterest recommends using tall images with an aspect ratio of 2:3, such as a 1,000 x 1,500 pixel size.

Pinterest influencers should also use visuals that capture their audience‚Äôs attention, as well as add compelling descriptions and keywords that users can search for.

### 3. Use Trending Hashtags

Pinterest allows users to add hashtags to their Idea Pins and boards.

Hashtags act as keywords that help Pinterest users find content that is related to a specific topic or niche.

Pinterest influencers should use trending hashtags that their audience is likely to search for. 

They can also look at what hashtags brands in their niche are using to get ideas on what hashtags to use in their content.

### 4. Engage With Your Audience

Pinterest influencers should actively engage with their audience to build a loyal community. 

They can respond to comments, messages, and inquiries, as well as follow back users who follow them.

Engaging with their audience helps Pinterest influencers understand their audience better, which will help them create better content.

Brands will also notice the engagement that influencers are generating, which can lead to more collaboration opportunities.

### 5. Be Professional

When reaching out to brands to pitch collaboration ideas, Pinterest influencers need to be professional in their approach. 

They should use a polite and professional tone when communicating with brands.

They should also introduce themselves properly, highlight what they can bring to the partnership, and thank the brand for their time.
