As an Instagram influencer in South Africa, you might have noticed the growing popularity of Japanese brands worldwide. With their unique aesthetics and dedication to quality, these brands are becoming the go-to choice for many consumers. 

Thus, if you want to stay relevant as an influencer and reach a wider audience, collaborating with Japanese brands is a great way to do so. 

In this article, we’ll reveal how to contact Japanese brands to get sponsored, the platforms to use, and some examples of Japanese brands you can work with. 

So, let’s dive in. 


## 📩 Effective Ways to Contact Japanese Brands

Japanese brands receive a lot of sponsorship requests from influencers worldwide. Thus, getting noticed by these brands can be quite challenging. 

Therefore, to increase your chances of getting noticed and collaborating with some of these brands, you need to use an effective strategy to reach out. Here are a few proven ways to get in contact with Japanese brands for influencer sponsorship requests. 

### 1. Email Them Directly

Reaching out via email is one of the best ways to contact brands and request sponsorship. Most brands have business emails listed on their websites, and even if they don’t, you can always use Google to find them. 

When reaching out via email, ensure that you personalize your email to increase your chances of getting a response. Here’s how to personalize your email to a Japanese brand. 

- **Use Their Brand Name in the Subject Line**: Using the brand name in the subject line shows you take your request seriously and are not sending out mass emails. 

- **Request Their Local Language Email**: If you suspect that the brand may not understand English very well and you can speak Japanese, ask them for their local language email. This will increase your chances of getting a response. 

- **Explain Why Working with You Will Benefit Them**: Instead of highlighting your metrics such as follower count and engagement rate, list all the reasons why working with you will benefit the brand.

### 2. Use Influencer Marketing Platforms

### 3. Contact Them Via The Contact Form on Their Website

Most brands check their contact form regularly, so you are likely to get a response. However, ensure you personalize your message when reaching out via the contact form. 

### 4. DM Them on Social Media

Most brands are active on social media, especially Instagram. Thus, reaching out via social media DM is a great way to contact brands. 

When reaching out via DM, ensure that you personalize your message to increase your chances of getting a response. 

You can also post stories tagging the brand and requesting sponsorship. This will increase your chances of getting noticed. 

### 5. Use LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a professional social media platform where you can connect with professionals and business owners in your niche. 

You can search for the brand or representatives working for the brand on LinkedIn and send them a connection request. 

Once they accept your request, you can send them a DM and request sponsorship.
