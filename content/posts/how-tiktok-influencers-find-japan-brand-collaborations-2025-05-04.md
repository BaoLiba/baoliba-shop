The wild world of TikTok is expanding rapidly, especially in South Africa. While creators are rapidly gathering millions of followers, many are beginning to tap into the lucrative world of influencer marketing.

The popularity of the platform has attracted big brands and the campaign strategies have evolved as well. South African TikTokers are now aspiring to work with Japan brands to get attention from the growing market of Japanese consumers.

If you‚Äôre a South African TikTok creator looking to collaborate with Japan brands, here's how to get started.

## üìà Why work with Japanese brands?

The numbers speak for themselves. Japan is the fastest growing e-commerce market in Asia and has a 90% penetration rate of digital commerce among its population.

Japanese consumers are trend-focused and often advocate for brands, making them a prime target for influencer marketing campaigns. In fact, 72% of Japanese consumers trust influencer recommendations more than brand advertising.

As consumer purchasing power rises, the demand for influencer marketing expertise increases, especially for savvy TikTok marketers.

## üîç Where to find Japan brands on TikTok?

Searching for Japan brands is quite simple on TikTok. Start by checking hashtags that are relevant to your niche, then search for videos that feature Japanese brands.

If you‚Äôre a fashion or beauty creator, hashtags like #JapaneseFashion and #JapaneseBeauty will yield a lot of results.

You can also search TikTok accounts that represent localised Japan brands. Look for brands that align with your niche so you can pitch a collaboration that would benefit both parties.

## üí° Collaborate with Japanese brands on Instagram

Many Japanese brands are still not familiar with TikTok marketing and are sticking with Instagram as their primary social media channel. Instagram is largely popular among brands in Japan.

Bamboo, a leading Japanese fashion brand, has over 100,000 followers on Instagram but only about 100 on TikTok. This is true for many other Japanese brands.

Although Instagram and TikTok have different audiences, they complement each other. You can use TikTok to attract attention and engage the audience, then direct them to your Instagram account where brands can make contact for collaborations.

Using Instagram hashtags relevant to Japanese brands can help you discover more opportunities. Examples of hashtags you can use include #Japanfashion and #Japanesebeauty.

## ü§ù How to Collaborate with Japanese brands as a South African TikToker

There are many types of partnerships you can explore with Japanese brands. Here are examples to try:

### 1. Sponsored posts

This is the most straightforward and common approach TikTokers use to engage with brands. A Japanese brand will pay you to create and publish an entertaining video that features their product or service in a manner that captivates your audience.

### 2. Affiliate marketing

Japanese brands are more likely to engage with you if they know they are getting something in return. By joining their affiliate program, you can earn a commission for every successful referral you make.

This is usually done through a unique referral link that you can include in your TikTok bio. Once you have signed up as an affiliate, create TikTok videos to promote the brand and encourage your viewers to buy through your link.

### 3. Giveaways

Engage your audience further by hosting a giveaway of a Japanese brand‚Äôs product. You can feature the product in a TikTok video and have them enter the contest by following both you and the brand. 

The brand can send the prize directly to the winner, which will reduce shipping costs for you. This is a great way to expose the brand to a wider audience without any financial investment from either party.

### 4. Become a brand ambassador

If a Japanese brand is keen to have you onboard, they may want to explore a long-term partnership. Being a brand ambassador means that you will have an ongoing collaboration with the brand.

You will continuously create TikTok content for their products and services and will be their go-to creator for every campaign. You can charge a retainer fee for the services you perform for them.

## üí∏ How to get paid by Japanese brands?

Once you secure a collaboration with a Japanese brand, you have to consider how to get paid. Luckily, you have a variety of payment options available in South Africa that Japanese brands can use.

### 1. Credit card payments

The easiest way for a Japanese brand to pay you is by debit or credit card. This is a straightforward process that takes very little time.

Simply provide your credit card details to the brand‚Äôs representative, and they can process the payment immediately. However, there is a risk of fraudulent activities when you share your card details.

### 2. Bank wire transfer

Japanese brands can send money directly to your bank account through a wire transfer. This can take a bit longer than credit card payments, but it is a reliable method of receiving funds.

Provide the brand with your banking details, including your account number and branch code, so they can process the transfer.

### 3. Online payment services

Japanese brands can also pay you through online payment services. Some services you can use include:

- **PayPal**: A popular online payment service that allows users to send and receive money quickly and securely. To use PayPal, you will need to create an account and link it to your bank account or credit card. Once you have set up your account, you can provide your PayPal email address to the Japanese brand so they can send you money through the service.
- **Wise**: Wise is an online money transfer service that allows you to send and receive money in different currencies at a low cost. You will need to create an account and provide your banking details to receive funds. Wise is a great option if you need to receive payments in Japanese Yen and want to avoid high conversion fees.
- **Skrill**: Skrill is another online payment service that allows you to send and receive money quickly and securely. Similar to PayPal, you will need to create an account and link it to your bank account or credit card. Provide your Skrill email address to the Japanese brand so they can send you money through the service.

## üîê Legal considerations

When working with Japanese brands as a South African TikTok influencer, there are legal considerations you need to keep in mind. Here are some key points:

### 1. Contract agreements

Always establish a contract agreement before commencing any collaboration with a Japanese brand. This will help protect both you and the brand in case of any disputes.

The agreement should clearly outline the terms of the partnership, including payment details, deliverables, timelines, and any other relevant information.

### 2. Tax implications

As a South African citizen, you are required to report and pay taxes on your worldwide income. This includes any earnings you receive from collaborations with Japanese brands.

Make sure to consult with a tax professional to ensure you comply with all tax regulations and requirements.

### 3. Intellectual property rights

Be mindful of intellectual property rights when creating TikTok content for Japanese brands. Ensure that you have permission to use any copyrighted material, such as music or images, in your videos.

Additionally, clarify in your contract agreement who owns the rights to the content you create for the brand. This will help avoid any potential disputes down the line.

## üåü Final thoughts

As the influencer marketing landscape continues to evolve, collaborating with Japanese brands is a key strategy for successful South African TikTok influencers.

By staying up to date with relevant hashtags, social media channels, and best practices, you can capitalize on this lucrative market and set yourself apart from the competition.
