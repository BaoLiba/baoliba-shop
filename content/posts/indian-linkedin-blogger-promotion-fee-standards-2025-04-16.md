## üìä The LinkedIn influencer marketing scene in India

Now, more than ever, India boasts a grand scene for influencer marketing across various platforms, including LinkedIn.

Since the pandemic, brands and agencies have had to rethink their marketing strategies. 

They have come to terms with the fact that reaching out to customers online is more efficient than engaging them physically.

With this development came the recognition of the influence that online influencers have on their audiences. 

This has pushed brands to engage influencers to facilitate their digital marketing strategies and policies in order to tap into the influencer's fanbase.

This is how India got her groove back when it comes to influencer marketing.

And India is not that shy kid that used to sit at the back of the classroom anymore.

India is now the best in the game!

According to a recent statistical report, India is now the world's biggest hub for influencer marketing, leading the industry in the number of marketing agencies and brands tapping into it.

The LinkedIn influencer marketing industry itself has rapidly gained popularity since the pandemic. 

Brands now understand the importance of LinkedIn as an essential space for B2B influencer marketing.

Statistically, it is the only platform that delivers B2B leads six times more than any other platform.

This statistic alone has put LinkedIn on top of the influencer marketing rankings in India, as Indians are some of the most participative users of LinkedIn in the world. 

They are also the third most participative users of LinkedIn in Asia behind the Philippines and Indonesia, and only ranked behind the Philippines in the South Asian region.

In recent years, India ranked first in Asia and second in the world for the highest spend on influencer marketing. 

A clear indication of how much the social media industry, and LinkedIn in particular, has grown and paved the way since the pandemic.

According to a recent survey, 68% of marketer respondents stated they had plans to spend more on influencer marketing across various platforms, that is a staggering 20% increase from last year.

This brings tremendous potential for marketing agencies and brands to flourish through influencer engagement in India.

LinkedIn as a B2B marketing platform delivers high-performing leads for those who seek to tap into India's vast consumer market.

## üë©‚Äçüé§ The Indian LinkedIn influencer

Indians have the highest spend on influencer marketing in Asia, and Indian influencers are nothing short of that spend. 

Just like any influencer across the world, LinkedIn influencers in India know what they are doing, and they are cashing in on that proficiency to help brands achieve their goals.

India has a cadre of LinkedIn influencers covering various fields and sectors, and their influencer marketing avenues are no less.

LinkedIn influencers in India are adept professionals who have already made their mark in their respective fields and sectors.

These influencers have an abundance of experience and expertise. 

As such, they can easily influence their audiences, as they have walked the walk and can attest to their journey.

They can reach out to an audience that brands cannot reach on their own.

For instance, the likes of Anand Mahindra, founder of India's Mahindra conglomerate, has claimed the title of India's number one LinkedIn influencer, and he is not the only big shot on the platform.

You can find c-suiters, government officials, entrepreneurs, executives, and other high-ranking professionals on the platform, and there is no shortage of pent-up demand for the private sector in India.

These professionals have amassed followers in the thousands and millions. 

This is where their true value lies, in their audience size.

This puts them in the best position to be an effective marketing intermediary for brands looking to tap into their audience.

Since they already have an established audience, they wouldn't have to spend so much time trying to build their audience up just to promote your brand.

They have already done that work, and they can put their audience to work for your brand at the snap of a finger.

With Indian LinkedIn influencers, your marketing woes shall be but a distant memory.

## üß© Factors affecting LinkedIn influencer marketing costs in India

There are a few factors that can affect costs when engaging an Indian LinkedIn influencer. 

These factors can range from how popular the influencer is, to how many posts you want them to make, and more.

### 1. Influencer tier

Influencer marketing agencies in India usually categorize influencers into different tiers according to their audience size. 

These tiers usually follow this scale:

- **Nano-influencers:** 1,000 - 10,000 followers
- **Micro-influencers:** 10,000 - 50,000 followers
- **Mid-tier influencers:** 50,000 - 250,000 followers
- **Macro-influencers:** 250,000 - 1 million followers
- **Mega-influencers:** 1 million plus followers

The more followers an influencer has, the more they usually charge for their services. 

Nano and micro influencers usually charge the least, while macro and mega influencers charge the most.

### 2. Scope of work 

Just like influencer tiers, every influencer's scope of work will be different. 

Some influencers are more experienced than others and can offer more in terms of services.

Some influencers might only promote your content or brand, while others may create and post content that promotes your brand.

More work usually means higher pay.

### 3. Your negotiation skills

When negotiating with an influencer, there is usually a back-and-forth exchange of offers until an agreement can be reached.

This means that you can get a better deal if you know what to say and how to say it. 

Developing sound negotiation skills can help you save money on marketing expenses and increase your overall returns.
