## üì≤ Why WhatsApp Influencer Marketing in Brazil?

Brazil has a younger population than the global average, with more than half of the Brazilian population aged 29 or younger. This demographic group is very active on social media, particularly Instagram and Twitter, but they also heavily use WhatsApp.

In fact, Brazilians spend an average of 4.1 hours on social media daily, and 90% of that time is spent on WhatsApp!

WhatsApp is popular in Brazil because it doesn‚Äôt require any login or signup information like Facebook or other social media platforms, making it easier for Brazilians to connect with their friends and family.

## üí∏ How Much Do WhatsApp Influencers Charge in Brazil?

Brazil has a massive influencer marketing industry, with the market expected to reach $4 billion in 2025. 

Brazilian influencers charge between $10 and $1,500 per sponsored post, depending on their popularity, the number of followers, and the niche they are in.

Micro influencers (1,000 - 10,000 followers) charge between $10 and $200 per post, while influencers with more than 100,000 followers can charge anywhere between $500 and $1,500 for the same post.
