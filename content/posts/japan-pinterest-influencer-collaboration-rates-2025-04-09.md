Japanese Pinterest influencers are charging South African brands how much for marketing? 

The rise of Japanese Pinterest influencers has created a buzz in South Africa, with some brands even considering them as the next golden ticket for influencer marketing across Asia Pacific.


## üöÄ Pinterest influencers vs regular influencers

Pinterest influencers and regular influencers are not the same thing. The biggest difference between the two is how they operate.

While regular influencers (think Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter) rely on high engagement to attract brands, Pinterest influencers engage their audiences in a more subtle manner. 


Pinterest influencers use Pinterest primarily as a search engine and social media platform to create visually appealing boards that showcase various lifestyle niches.

For brands targeting specific lifestyle niches, Pinterest influencers can increase visibility and drive traffic to their websites.


## üí∞ 2025 influencer payout

While the Pinterest influencer marketing campaign price can vary greatly, a panel of experts recently revealed that the average influencer payment in 2023 is as follows: 

- **$500 per pin**
- **$2000 per Pinterest board**
- **$4000 per Pinterest marketing campaign**


## üö© Japanese Pinterest influencer marketing prices per post

According to Baoliba, Korean Pinterest influencers are charging between $300 and $1,424 on average for each sponsored post.

Thus, South African brands can expect to pay 40% more for their Japanese counterparts. 

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of several different price ranges and what South African brands can get at each:

| Pinterest influencer engagement type  | Price range | What South African brands get |
|:--------------------------------------|------------:|:---------------------------------|
| Basic pin  |  $500 - $700    |  1 basic pin with a link to your website.  |
|  Video pin | $1,000 - $1,300 | 1 video pin with a link to your website.  |
|  Carousel pin  | $2,000 - $2,400 | 1 carousel pin with 5 images and a link to your website.  |
|  Board  | $2,500 - $2,800 | 1 Pinterest board with 30 images and a link to your website.  |
|  Pinterest profile | $2,800 - $3,200 |  1 Pinterest board with 45 images and a link to your website. |
|  Pinterest campaign  | $3,500 - $4,000 | 1 Pinterest board with 60 images and a link to your website. |


Brands that want to hire Japanese Pinterest influencers from South Africa will also need to pay the Japanese influencer marketing agency fees.


## üè™ Japanese Pinterest influencers vs Japanese influencers

While any influencer with a Pinterest account can operate as a Pinterest influencer, there are no hard and fast rules to distinguish between the two in terms of price point. 

For the most part, though, here‚Äôs what we generally see in terms of average pricing between Japanese influencers and their Pinterest counterparts:

| Japanese influencer engagement type  | Price range | What South African brands get |
|:--------------------------------------|------------:|:---------------------------------|
| Instagram post | $300 - $800 | 1 Instagram post. |
| Instagram story | $200 - $250 | 1 Instagram story. |
| TikTok post | $300 - $600 | 1 TikTok post. |
| YouTube video | $300 - $1,600 | 1 YouTube video. |
| YouTube short | $200 - $350 | 1 YouTube short. |
| Blog post | $100 - $300 | 1 blog post. |


Instagram influencers in Japan will generally cost South African brands half of Pinterest influencers. 

Therefore, if brands are looking for more affordable options, they can just hire Japanese influencers with Instagram posts or blog posts instead.


## üí≥ Pinterest influencer payment methods
