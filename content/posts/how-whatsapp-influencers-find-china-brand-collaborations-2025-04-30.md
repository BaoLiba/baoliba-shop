In Q4 of 2022, an impressive 98% of internet users in South Africa were using WhatsApp.

The app is so popular that people are continuing to use it as a social media platform even after Meta announced it would eliminate features designed for that purpose.

This means WhatsApp is an ideal platform for influencers wanting to collaborate with China brands in 2025 and beyond.

So, how can you leverage WhatsApp if you are a South African influencer looking to partner with China brands?

Let‚Äôs find out.

## üìû Why WhatsApp is Ideal for Influencer Marketing

According to the 2023 South Africa Digital Report by We Are Social and Hootsuite, WhatsApp is not only the most used social app in South Africa. It is also the most used social media channel in the country.

Despite WhatsApp's intended purpose as a messaging platform, it is viewed as a social media app by many users.

South African influencers can utilize WhatsApp's popularity to reach a large number of followers or potential customers, enhancing their chances of securing partnerships with China brands.

In fact, the report also found that South Africa boasts an impressive number of social media users overall, with 43.9 million active accounts. This translates to 72.7% of the entire population.

As such, it is an opportune time for South African influencers to tap into the marketing power of WhatsApp.

## üì≤ WhatsApp Stats Every Influencer Should Know

Research shows that influencers and content creators are viewed as the most trustworthy sources of information by South African consumers.

They also reported that direct messages, posts, videos, and stories are the most effective methods for influencers to reach and engage their customers.

What‚Äôs more, 90% of South Africans are open to being influenced by social media ads.

Almost half of South African respondents (47%) reported that they have made a purchase based on a social media recommendation.

With WhatsApp being such a widely used platform, brands can maximize conversion rates by using influencers to market their products on the app.

## üìà Why Partnering With China Brands Will Benefit South African Influencers

Many South African consumers are increasingly turning to China brands for their purchasing decisions.

In fact, 86% of South African consumers are more likely to purchase a product from a Chinese company rather than a domestic or Western brand. This indicates that influencers should not hesitate to partner with Chinese brands.

China brands have an impressive track record of providing high-quality products at competitive prices.

The country is known for being the world's largest manufacturer, producing a wide range of products across various categories, including electronics, clothing, household goods, and more, making it easier for South African influencers to find brands in various niches to partner with.

## üíª Finding China Brands on WhatsApp

Influencers looking to partner with China brands on WhatsApp should first consider utilizing online platforms that connect brands with influencers.

These platforms often provide a range of tools and features to facilitate collaborations, such as messaging, campaign management, and analytics.

One such platform is BaoLiba, a leading influencer marketing service that connects international brands with influencers in over 100 countries, including South Africa.

It specializes in helping brands from around the world, including China, establish partnerships with local influencers.

Influencers can sign up for free on the BaoLiba platform, create a compelling profile, and gain access to thousands of campaigns from reputable brands looking for partnerships.

Once a South African influencer has signed up on BaoLiba, they can easily search for China brands looking for influencers on WhatsApp.

These brands will often include their WhatsApp numbers in their campaigns. Interested influencers can then reach out to them directly on WhatsApp to discuss potential collaborations.

## üì¢ How to Get Noticed by China Brands

If you're a South African influencer eager to partner with Chinese brands on WhatsApp, establishing a compelling profile on influencer marketing platforms like BaoLiba is essential. Here are a few tips to help you stand out:

- **Select Your Account Type**: Choose the "influencer" account type during the sign-up process to access exclusive marketing resources.

- **Create a Catchy Headline**: Your headline should grab attention and summarize your expertise. For example: "Skincare Enthusiast and Expert Bringing You the Best Tips on IG and Facebook".

- **Write a Compelling Bio**: Your bio should outline your skills and niche. Use bullet points for easy reading. For instance:
  - üì∏ Expert in creating engaging content
  - üåç Passionate about skincare
  - ü§ù Open to partnerships

- **Add Links**: Include links to your social media accounts and any relevant websites to showcase your work and outreach, such as your Instagram, TikTok, and blogs.

- **Highlight Your Work**: Showcase your achievements, skills, and any notable collaborations to attract attention.

- **Add a Profile Photo**: Use a professional profile photo to enhance trustworthiness and make your profile visually appealing.

- **Verify Your Account**: Once you've set up your profile, submit a request for verification. A verified badge increases your credibility and attracts more opportunities.

By creating a standout profile, you'll enhance your visibility and improve your chances of being noticed by Chinese brands seeking partnerships on WhatsApp.

## üí∞ Payment Options for South African Influencers Collaborating with China Brands

If you're a South African influencer looking to partner with Chinese brands on WhatsApp, it's essential to be aware of the payment options available to you.

While many Chinese brands prefer to pay through online payment platforms like PayPal or Western Union, some are now even open to paying influencers in cryptocurrency.

However, due to the complexities and potential risks associated with these payment methods, Chinese brands are more likely to pay through bank transfers.

But how can South African influencers facilitate bank transfers from China?

The answer is simple. Sign up for a Wise account.

Wise is an online banking service that allows users from anywhere in the world to hold and transfer money across 54 currencies.

This means that when a Chinese influencer marketing brand pays a South African influencer through Wise, the brand can pay in Renminbi (RMB), and the South African influencer will receive the payment in South African Rand (ZAR).

Wise provides this service at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional banks and online payment platforms.

## üéâ Conclusion

WhatsApp‚Äôs popularity in South Africa makes it a great platform for influencers to connect with local audiences.

As a result, it is an ideal avenue for South African influencers looking to partner with China brands in 2025 and beyond.

By leveraging influencer marketing platforms like BaoLiba, and optimizing their profiles, South African influencers can position themselves for potential collaborations with China brands.

They can also facilitate payments through online services such as Wise to ensure they get paid for their marketing efforts.
