Many South African¬†influencers¬†have successfully partnered with Spain-based brands to promote their products and services on Instagram.

A Spain-based fashion brand can take your promotional efforts to the next level and enable your engagements to skyrocket¬†on Instagram.

In fact, in 2025, Spain brands will be the go-to option for South African influencers looking to increase their visibility through social media influencer marketing.

South African influencers can find Spain brands to work with by using¬†local influencer marketing agencies¬†that already have partnerships with these brands.

They can also find Spain brands themselves by searching for them on Instagram and reaching out to them directly via DM.


## üéØ Get the attention of Spain brands by increasing your Instagram engagement rate


An Instagram engagement rate of 5% and above is ideal¬†for brands looking for influencers to partner with.
An influencer with a low engagement rate is less likely to attract the attention of Spain brands looking to partner with South African influencers.

This means that as a South African influencer¬†seeking to collaborate¬†with Spain brands in 2025, you need to increase your Instagram engagement rate.

You can do so by:

- Posting engaging content that resonates with your target audience.
- Engaging more with your followers by responding to their comments and messages.
- Collaborating with other influencers to tap into their audience.


## üì¢ Use local influencers marketing agencies to connect with Spain brands


Locally based influencer marketing agencies have an extensive portfolio of brands from different countries that they work with.
Some of these agencies work with brands that are based in Spain.

By partnering with these agencies, South African influencers can gain access to Spain brands and create successful collaborations.

The influencer marketing agency also takes care of the negotiations and contracts, making the process easier for influencers.

In addition to Spain brands, these agencies also work with many South African brands that influencers can also promote.

Some of the local influencer marketing agencies that South African influencers can partner with to connect with Spain brands in 2025 include:

- Cape Town-based¬†7th Avenue
-¬†Durban-based¬†Glow 
- Johannesburg-based¬†Fanz
- Cape Town-based¬†City Sightseeing Cape Town 


## üéâ Reach out directly to Spain brands on Instagram


Spain brands are more likely to accept promotional cooperation from South African influencers if they approach them directly.
Spain brands can easily be found on Instagram by searching for them using the platform‚Äôs search feature.

Even if South African influencers have not been approached by Spain brands, they can still find them on Instagram and reach out to them via Direct Message. 

The key to successfully getting Spain brands to partner with South African influencers is to have a strong pitch that showcases the value¬†that they can bring to the brand.

Some of the Spain brands that South African influencers can reach out to them in 2025 include:

- Apparel brand Pull&Bear
- Cosmetics brand¬†Beter
- Footwear brand¬†Skechers


## üö¶ Pilfer existing relationships with Spanish influencers


Spanish influencers can recommend South African influencers to brands that they already work with and help facilitate collaborations.
South African influencers can also opt to work with Spanish influencers and reach out to them for suggestions on Spain brands to work with.

Spanish influencers will have firsthand information on which brands are currently looking for influencers.

South African influencers can also easily find Spanish influencers on Instagram and reach out to them to pitch their ideas.
They can offer a mutually beneficial partnership where both parties promote each other‚Äôs profiles to gain more visibility.


## üí∞ Get paid in Euros to promote Spain brands


One of the biggest benefits of promoting Spain brands as a South African influencer is getting paid in Euros.
This is mainly because brands that are based in Spain typically pay influencers in Euros.

Influencers can benefit from the higher currency exchange rate¬†of Euros to South African Rand.
For instance, at the time of writing this article, 1 Euro is equal to R19.38.

This means that if a South African influencer is paid 1,000 Euros to promote a Spain brand, they will receive R19,380. 


## ‚ùó Be wary of fake Spanish brands on Instagram


While South African influencers can find many legitimate Spain brands on Instagram, they should also be wary of fake brands.
Fake brands usually have unverified accounts and few followers.

They may also have very few posts and posts that are unoriginal and sourced from other users.

Fake brands often promise to pay influencers to promote their products but will not do so.
Sometimes they may ask influencers to pay upfront for their products with the promise that they will pay them later.

It is advisable for South African influencers to do their homework and research Spain brands that they want to work with.

Influencers can check the brand‚Äôs website and social media pages for reviews and testimonials from previous collaborators.

They should also watch out for common red flags¬†such as:

- New accounts with few followers and posts
- Poor quality content
- Overly edited images
- Unclear payment guidelines
- Multiple spelling and grammatical errors in their bio and posts
- Messy feed layout 
- Many posts with no engagement


## ‚úâÔ∏è How to tell if a brand is fake or real


If the brand has thousands of followers but only a few likes or comments on their posts, this is a sign that they may have bought their followers, and they may be fake.
Brands that are actively engaged usually have a following that corresponds to their engagement levels.

Many fake brands often spam influencers with collaboration requests.

If the brand that a South African influencer wants to work with has sent them a collaboration request that seems too good to be true, they should carefully assess the request.

They can also ask for references from other influencers who have worked with the brand in the past. 

Asking for references is a good way to confirm if a brand is genuine or not.


## üí° Conclusion

Spain brands can be found on Instagram in 2025 by South African influencers looking for collaboration opportunities.
It is advisable for South African influencers seeking to work with Spain brands to partner with local influencer marketing agencies, reach out to Spain brands directly, and collaborate with Spanish influencers to get brand recommendations.
