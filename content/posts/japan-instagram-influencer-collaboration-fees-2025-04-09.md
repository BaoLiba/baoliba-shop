Japan's influencer marketing industry is expected to reach ¬•37.57 billion in 2025, with an influencer marketing revenue growth rate of 20.5%.

Global influencer marketing is experiencing a similar trend, with the industry expected to grow from $13.8 billion in 2021 to $26.4 billion by 2027.


## üì¢ Japan is Seen to be the Biggest Player in Asia

Japan has become Asia‚Äôs largest influencer marketing player, accounting for over 50% of the continent‚Äôs total revenue from influencer marketing.

Japan is a huge market for influencer marketing, and businesses are investing heavily in campaigns that attract the attention of local influencers.


## üì¢ Local Influencer Objectives

Japanese influencers have a different objective than social media users in other countries. Most of them want to entertain their followers rather than sell to them, especially those that are already famous before they became influencers.

In Japan, influencers are considered entertainers, and that is why they focus on providing entertainment rather than selling to their audiences.


## üì¢ Japan has Unique Social Media Platforms

Japan has unique social media platforms that locals use more than global platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

Some of the most popular Japanese social media platforms are:
- LINE
- TikTok
- Instagram
- Twitter
- Facebook

According to Statista, LINE is the leading social media platform in Japan with over 90 million users. Instagram is the fourth largest platform with 31 million users, while TikTok is rapidly gaining a following.


## üì¢ International Brands are Dominating Japanese Influencer Marketing

While Japan has unique social media platforms, many international brands are dominating influencer marketing in Japan. According to Researcgate, over 60% of influencers work with international brands.

60% of influencers working with foreign brands is quite a high percentage when local brands have access to the same influencers. The lack of interest from local brands can be attributed to the fact that they don‚Äôt want to engage influencers that work with their competitors.

Although local brands would prefer to work with influencers that do not engage their competitors, they can still work with them if they agree to not post about a competitor‚Äôs products for a specified amount of time, or restrict the posts to one platform.


## üì¢ The Influence in Japanese Influencer Marketing

Japan has unique influencers known as ‚Äúotaku‚Äù who have a huge following, especially among the younger generations.

Otaku are social media users with obsessive interests, or hobbies, that they are willing to share with others. Some interests that otaku have include gaming, anime, manga, movies, and certain celebrities. They share their obsessions with others through social media, online forums, and other channels.

While otaku are considered to be geeky and socially awkward, they are highly influential among their peers. Otaku can promote a product or service to a specific niche market, and that can significantly boost the sales figures of the brands they work with.


## üì¢ Japanese Influencers Charge Different Rates

According to Kiplingers, Japan influencers have varying rates that they charge brands for their services. Instagram influencers charge from $20 to over $1500 per post, with some charging $300 to $500 for a story post.

YouTube influencers charge the most, with those with over 3 million followers charging up to $5000 per sponsored video.

Social media influencers who post about products or services on social media typically charge:
- $10 to $200 per post for Facebook.
- $150 to $250 for Instagram posts.
- $300 for Instagram stories.
- $20 to $500 for TikTok videos.
- $200 to $800 for YouTube videos.

Most Japanese influencers charge less than their counterparts in other parts of the world. This is because influencer marketing is not yet a mature industry in Japan, which means it can still grow significantly.


## üì¢ Larger Influencers Charge More Than Smaller Influencers

Larger influencers, or those with more followers, tend to charge more than smaller influencers. This is true in Japan and in most regions of the world.

Instead of charging brands per post, some influencers charge brands a monthly retainer fee to manage their accounts. Influencers who charge brands a monthly retainer fee typically have a large following, and charge an average fee of $4000.

In addition to the retainer fee, brands may have to pay for promotional expenses, or ad spend, that are incurred by influencers when they promote their products or services.


## üì¢ Japan Influencers have Generally Low Return on Investment

Japanese influencers have a relatively low Return on Investment (ROI) when it comes to influencer marketing. In fact, India has the highest ROI, followed by the USA, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.

According to Foundr, Japan has an average ROI of around $3.58 to $4.88 for every dollar invested in influencer marketing.


## üì¢ Japan Influencer Marketing Trends

Japan has a unique influencer marketing landscape that is different from other regions. Marketers need to be aware of the trends in Japan, including the fact that:
- Japan is a saturated market when it comes to influencers. Marketing managers will find it difficult to differentiate influencers from the competition.
- Instagram is on the rise, especially for influencer marketing. Instagram‚Äôs popularity has been growing across the world, and Japan is no exception.
- Many influencers are more interested in earning a steady income rather than one time payments.
- The Japanese audience prefers to follow influencers that they find relatable.
- Quality content is vital in Japanese influencer marketing. Japanese audiences appreciate high-quality content, and marketing managers need to ensure that the influencers they work with post high-quality content.


## Conclusion

Influencer marketing in Japan is still a relatively new marketing strategy, and that means it can grow significantly in the near future. Influencer marketing is expected to grow further, as more brands understand how valuable influencers are to promoting their products and services. 

In Japan, influencer marketing can work well for brands, especially if they stay abreast of trends in influencer marketing. Brands that want to work with Japanese influencers but do not know where to start can approach an influencer marketing agency to help them get started.
