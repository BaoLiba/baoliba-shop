In the fast-paced world of influencer marketing, tech-savvy South African influencers are stepping up their game by using Messenger to connect with Turkey brands. 

This dynamic duo is capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the social media platform.

But why Turkey brands, you might ask? 

Turkey is an emerging market in the Middle East, and they are establishing a foothold in Africa. Consequently, many Turkish brands are looking to collaborate with influencers to help with their marketing strategies. 

To navigate the world of Messenger influencer marketing, South African influencers need to be equipped with the right knowledge and tools to get their foot in the door with prospective Turkish brands.

In this article, we will help you do just that. 


## üìä What is Messenger Influencer Marketing?

Coined in 2019, Messenger influencer marketing is when brands use Messenger to find and collaborate with influencers.

The Messenger app is a communication platform that allows users to send messages, make voice calls, send photos and videos, and even share locations with friends, family, or business contacts. 

Many South African influencers have used the app to communicate with brands and fans alike. 

However, as we move into 2025, Messenger will become more integrated with the Facebook platform. As a result, Messenger will be the primary communication channel for brands when connecting with up-and-coming social media influencers.



## üìà How South Africa Influencers Can Connect With Turkey Brands

Whether you are a micro-influencer or a macro-influencer, the first step in this process is to understand what Turkey brands are looking for in a partnership.

Generally, brands look for influencers with a substantial following and engagement rate. Specifically, brands want influencers who create high-quality content that aligns with their brand values.

Instagram insights provide influencers with information about their followers, including age, gender, location, and activity. These insights allow influencers to tailor their content to resonate with their audience and attract potential brand partners.

More importantly, influencers should pay attention to the demographics of their followers. If the majority of their followers are from Turkey, they should capitalize on that as it will be a major talking point when pitching themselves to Turkey brands.

3. **Post High-quality Content Regularly**

Influencers need to create and post high-quality content that showcases their personality, style, and skills. 

This includes professional photos, engaging captions, and relevant hashtags. Brands look for influencers who can create visually appealing content that aligns with their brand image.

## ü§ù How to Pitch to Turkey Brands

After establishing a strong presence on Instagram and Messenger, the next step for South African influencers is to pitch themselves to Turkey brands. 

Here are some tips on how to effectively pitch to Turkey brands using Messenger:

1. **Do Your Research**

Before reaching out to Turkey brands, South African influencers should research the brand, its values, and its target audience. 

By understanding the brand‚Äôs goals and challenges, influencers can tailor their pitch to address the brand‚Äôs specific needs. This shows the brand that the influencer is genuinely interested in collaborating and has taken the time to understand their business.

2. **Craft a Compelling Message**

3. **Include a Portfolio or Media Kit**

Including a portfolio or media kit in the message is a great way for South African influencers to showcase their work and credibility.

This provides brands with valuable information and demonstrates the influencer‚Äôs professionalism and expertise. 

4. **Follow Up Politely**

If a Turkey brand does not respond to the initial pitch, South African influencers should follow up politely after a few days. 

A friendly follow-up message can remind the brand of the collaboration opportunity and encourage them to respond. However, influencers should avoid being pushy or spammy, as this can create a negative impression. 

5. **Be Authentic**

Authenticity is key in influencer marketing. South African influencers should be genuine and authentic in their pitch messages to Turkey brands. 

This includes being honest about their following, engagement rates, and past collaborations. By being transparent, influencers can build trust and credibility with brands, increasing the likelihood of collaboration opportunities.

6. **Be Patient and Persistent**

Securing collaborations with Turkey brands may take time and effort. South African influencers should be patient and persistent in their outreach efforts. 

By consistently pitching to brands and following up, influencers can increase their chances of securing collaboration opportunities.
