If you‚Äôre looking to explore the exciting world of WhatsApp influencer marketing in India, follow the guidance below to find the perfect influencers for your brand collaborations.

## üì≤ Why Collaborate With WhatsApp Influencers In India?

WhatsApp is one of the most popular social media platforms in India, with over 500 million users. With 68% of users aged between 18-34 years old, brands have a unique opportunity to reach a large share of their target audiences. 

WhatsApp influencer marketing is also cost-effective, with brands spending an average of $75 for a collaboration. Compared to other platforms, this is significantly lower than the $1,200 brands spend on Instagram collaborations, as well as the $1,000 average cost for TikTok collaborations.  

Furthermore, WhatsApp engagement rates are among the highest of social media platforms, with a whopping 98% of messages opened and read. Compared to Facebook and Instagram which have open rates of 70% and 30% respectively, WhatsApp is an ideal platform for influencer marketing in India.

## üè¥ Types of WhatsApp Influencers in India

Success in WhatsApp influencer marketing begins with finding the right influencers to collaborate with. Here are the different types of influencers who can help you generate buzz around your brand.

### 1. Micro-Influencers

Micro-influencers are influencers who have between 1,000 to 100,000 followers. These influencers are ideal for brands who want to reach niche audiences. 

Micro-influencers are also considered among the most effective influencers for collaborations, as they tend to have a more engaged follower base. Research shows that 82% of consumers are likely to follow the recommendations of a micro-influencer.

### 2. Mega-Influencers

Mega-influencers are influencers who have over 1 million followers. These influencers are ideal for brands looking to achieve mass marketing and brand awareness.

### 3. Content Creators

Content creators are professionals who create original content for social media platforms. While some influencers are content creators, not all content creators are influencers. 

Content creators are ideal for brands looking for professional-grade content. Unlike regular influencers who often have a more casual and authentic aesthetic, content creators can deliver polished content that can be used across different marketing channels.

Finding the ideal WhatsApp influencers for brand collaborations doesn‚Äôt have to be a daunting task. Here are some of the best methods to find influencers who will meet your marketing needs.

### 1. Use Influencer Marketing Platforms

## üìä How to Collaborate With WhatsApp Influencers

WhatsApp influencer marketing is more than just sending a few products to an influencer and expecting them to create buzz for your brand. To achieve successful collaborations, brands need to adhere to these best practices.

### 1. Communicate Your Goals

Communicating your goals with influencers is vital for successful collaborations. Be clear about your expectations, such as the type of content you want them to create, deadlines, and other deliverables.

### 2. Follow Legal Guidelines

Brands need to adhere to legal guidelines when collaborating with influencers. According to the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) 2022 guidelines, influencers must disclose collaborations by using clear and conspicuous disclaimers. 

Disclaimers such as #ad or #sponsored must be included within the first three lines of the WhatsApp status. This allows followers to see the disclaimer immediately, unlike other placements where they have to click ‚Äúmore‚Äù to see it.

### 3. Test and Measure Results

Testing and measuring results is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of WhatsApp influencer marketing campaigns. Use tracking links and discount codes to measure the results of each influencer collaboration. 

For example, if influencer A uses a discount code ‚ÄúB10‚Äù for their collaboration, you can measure the number of sales generated from it. This will help you determine whether to continue collaborating with them in future campaigns.

## üí° Conclusion

WhatsApp influencer marketing is one of the most effective ways for brands in India to reach their target audiences. With high engagement rates and low costs, brands can achieve impressive results with the right influencers. Use the methods and best practices listed above to find the ideal influencers for your WhatsApp marketing campaigns.
