Finding brands to collaborate with as a YouTuber can be a tough journey, especially if you are filming and uploading videos in South Africa for Italian brands. Most times, you will find yourself running into roadblocks that prevent you from making that important brand partnership.

There is a specific approach to influencer marketing for Italian brands that YouTubers must utilize if they want to be successful in their efforts. 

So, if you are looking for brands in Italy that you can collaborate with as a South African YouTuber, keep reading as we are about to break down the essential steps that you need to take.

## üéØ Why Collaborating With Italian Brands Is Important

For most South African YouTubers, the focus is primarily on securing local South African brands for collaborations. This is great for building a loyal following and becoming an authority in your niche.

However, working with brands that are outside of South Africa is also beneficial. For one, it can broaden your audience, giving you exposure to potential subscribers and viewers from another part of the world.  

Collaborating with brands that are outside South Africa can also make you stand out from the crowd, helping you to become an authority in your niche as well. 

In 2024 and beyond, brands are expected to become more global in their approach to marketing. This is in part due to the internet providing a level of access that we have never seen before. 

What this means for you is that you can target brands in any part of the world, including Italy, and become a partner for them.

Here are a few things that you can do to reach out to Italian brands.

### ‚ùó Understand The Italian Culture

As a South African YouTuber who is interested in working with Italian brands, you must first understand the culture of the people you are trying to work with.

Italy is a country located in Southern Europe and comprises a large peninsula and several islands. Its culture is influenced by its history, which has seen it stand as a part of the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and the unification of Italy. 

Italians pride themselves on their rich history, traditions, and family values. They are known for being warm and welcoming, and they place great importance on food, fashion, and art.

In terms of clothing, Italians tend to dress well and have a keen sense of style. They prefer to wear tailored clothes that are made from high-quality materials. 

When it comes to food, Italians are passionate about their cuisine and take great pride in their culinary traditions.

Italians typically enjoy leisurely meals with family and friends and appreciate good wine and coffee. 

They also have a strong appreciation for the arts and culture, with Florence being the birthplace of the Renaissance. 

In terms of social etiquette, Italians tend to be warm and tactile, often greeting friends and acquaintances with a kiss on both cheeks.

They value personal relationships and prefer face-to-face communication over email or phone calls. 

Italians also appreciate good manners and politeness, so it is important to be respectful and courteous in social situations. 

### ‚úîÔ∏è It‚Äôs Better To Use Italian

Italian brands are more likely to respond positively to you if you reach out to them in Italian.

Although most Italians speak English, using their native language will show them that you have put in the work to learn their language.  

One way to learn Italian is to use a language app like Duolingo. Duolingo is a mobile app that provides a fun and easy way to learn Italian through games and quizzes. 

You can also use an online language exchange platform such as Tandem or HelloTalk. These platforms allow you to connect with native Italian speakers who want to learn English. 

By chatting with them in Italian, you‚Äôll gain valuable speaking and writing practice. 

### ‚ùó Use Italian Platforms

Using Italian websites to reach out to brands will also increase your chances of getting a positive response. 

Instead of using Instagram or Facebook, which are common platforms that are used worldwide, you should reach out to brands using Italian platforms. 

### üìß  Use Email Marketing

Email marketing is one of the best ways to get your proposal in front of the right people. 

Most brands have an email address that you can reach them at. All you‚Äôll need to do is visit their website and look for their contact information. 

Once you have their email address, you can send them a proposal that outlines why you would be a good fit for them, what you can do for them, and how they can get in touch with you.  

You can also include links to your YouTube channel and other social media profiles to give them a better idea of your content.

### ‚ùó Use Brand Collaboration Platforms

Brand collaboration platforms are websites and applications that connect brands with influencers and content creators.
