## ü§ù Finding Germany Brands for Collaborations


### Submit a Proposal

One of the easiest ways for South African LinkedIn influencers to collaborate with Germany brands is to submit a proposal. 

When submitting a proposal, influencers should include their LinkedIn profile link as well as campaign ideas. 

They must also provide their contact details and state their location. This will help Germany brands understand the influencer's location. If a Germany brand is interested, they can start a conversation with the influencer. 

### Use LinkedIn‚Äôs Find an Influencer Tool

LinkedIn offers a tool that allows brands to find relevant influencers and creators for their campaigns. 

Although this tool is more often used by brands to find influencers, influencers can also use it to find brands that are looking for them. 

To use this tool, influencers must go to the dedicated page and select their role as an influencer. They must also select their region, which should be Europe. 

This will help Germany brands to find them easily.

### Network with Germany Brands

When a Germany brand accepts an invitation to connect, South African influencers can further introduce themselves, provide their LinkedIn profile link, and offer their services. Influencers should also include their location.

### Join LinkedIn Groups

South African LinkedIn influencers should also join groups that are focused on influencer marketing. They can use the search bar to search for keywords such as "influencer marketing" to find relevant groups.

They can also search for groups related to Germany or those that include Germany brands. 

Once they join such groups, they can participate in discussions and promote themselves. 

### Use Hashtags

South African LinkedIn influencers can also use relevant hashtags to attract the attention of Germany brands. 

Some of the hashtags they can use include hashtags like #Germany, #Germanybrands, or #Germanyinfluencers. 

They can also use hashtags that relate to the products they want to promote. For example, if they want to promote a product from a Germany cosmetics brand, they can use hashtags like #beauty, #skincare, or #cosmetics. 


## üí≤ Payment methods for collaborating with Germany brands

Due to the exchange rates between the Euro and the South African Rand, South African LinkedIn influencers should ensure that a Germany brand pays them in their currency.
