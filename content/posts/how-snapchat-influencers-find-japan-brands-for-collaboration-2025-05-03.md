In 2025, if I were a Japanese company looking to partner with Snapchat influencers, I would probably start my search in the following avenues.



## 📢 照亮网上的空白

Do an online search for Snapchat influencer marketing agencies with a Japan presence. To make your search easier, I would suggest using Google’s Japanese search engine. 

The Japanese have a saying that states “the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.” This means that Japanese people prefer to blend into a crowd instead of standing out, which is why you may find that many Japanese companies prefer to use influencer marketing agencies instead of going directly to influencers.

When searching for Snapchat influencer marketing agencies that cater to the Japan influencer marketing space, I found a few that might help you along your way.

### 📢 Grape Japan

They can help put together a Snapchat marketing campaign that features Snapchat influencers who appeal to Japanese audiences.

They have a large network of influencers in various niches and can help you create engaging and effective campaigns that drive results. 

### 📢 YouTube

While the Japanese are known for their penchant for unique and innovative digital marketing tactics, they are also known for being quite traditional when it comes to their media consumption habits.

Japan is the second largest market for YouTube behind the US, and it is likely that Japanese companies will look closely at YouTube influencers when conducting their influencer marketing campaigns.

What this means for Snapchat influencers is that they can optimize their performance on YouTube, and use that as a leverage point when contacting Japanese companies for collaborations. 

### 📢 Niche down

Snapchat influencers can expand their reach in the Japanese market by nicheing down and showcasing their expertise in a particular area. 

Understanding the Japanese culture can go a long way in appealing to Japanese audiences. Knowing what makes them tick, and what gets their attention can help Snapchat influencers increase their chances of landing collaborations with Japanese brands.

Japan is well known for its anime scene, so a Snapchat influencer who specializes in anime is more likely to land collaborations with Japanese brands than a general Snapchat influencer who dabbles in different niches.

#### 📢 Use Japanese creators 

Partner with Japanese creators who can help you create content that resonates with Japanese audiences. Working with Japanese creators can also help you get around the language barrier and help you avoid making cultural missteps that can ruin your campaign.

Japanese creators can also help you bridge the trust gap that Japanese audiences may have towards non-Japanese influencers. 

Snap influencers who are unable to partner with Japanese creators can still create content in Japanese by using translation tools like Google Translate or Deepl.

### 📢 Use paid ads 

Paid ads can help Snapchat influencers reach Japanese audiences and increase their chances of landing collaborations with Japanese brands.

Snapchat has a built-in advertising platform that allows influencers to run ads on the platform. Snapchat influencers can create engaging and visually appealing ads that promote their brand and attract the attention of Japanese companies.

Snapchat ads allow influencers to target specific audiences, which can be helpful when trying to reach Japanese audiences. 

### 📢 Use hashtags  

Snapchat influencers can use hashtags to increase their visibility and reach Japanese audiences. 

Hashtags are searchable keywords that help people find content related to a specific topic. By using relevant hashtags in their posts, Snapchat influencers can increase their chances of being discovered by Japanese companies looking for influencers to collaborate with.

#### 📢 Leverage social media

Use social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to showcase your work and connect with Japanese brands. Many Japanese companies use social media to find influencers for their marketing campaigns, so having a strong social media presence can help you land more collaborations.

#### 📢 Attend events 

Attending events related to your niche can help you connect with Japanese brands and increase your chances of landing collaborations. Many brands attend events to find influencers for their marketing campaigns, so being present at these events can help you get noticed.

### 📢 Reach out to brands

Do your research and find brands that align with your values and aesthetic. Reach out to them and pitch your ideas for collaborations. Many brands are open to working with influencers, especially if they see potential in your work.

Be sure to include your media kit, which should showcase your statistics, previous collaborations, and contact information.
