WhatsApp is the most popular social media app in South Africa. While other platforms are also commonly used, such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, WhatsApp is the number one platform for connecting with friends, family, and brands.

The use of WhatsApp for marketing purposes is on the rise, and brands are looking for influencers on WhatsApp to help them market their products or services through WOM (word-of-mouth) marketing.

Online influencers, including those on WhatsApp, have a significant impact on the purchasing behaviours of their audiences. If you are a WhatsApp influencer looking to take your marketing efforts to the next level, consider reaching out to United States brands for collaboration opportunities.

This article will explore how you can find and partner with brands in the United States as a WhatsApp influencer in South Africa.

## 📩  Finding US Brands as a WhatsApp Influencer

While the United States is thousands of miles away from South Africa, there are many brands located in the US that are interested in marketing their products to a South African audience. WhatsApp influencers can help United States brands reach South African consumers through the marketing prowess of WhatsApp.

By collaborating with WhatsApp influencers in South Africa, US brands can:

1. Build brand awareness in South Africa

4. Increase sales in South Africa

As a South African WhatsApp influencer, you can help US brands achieve these goals through your marketing efforts. But how can you find United States brands to collaborate with?

To find brands, you have to understand what brands are looking for. United States brands are looking for influencers that can provide them with a significant return on investment (ROI). As a WhatsApp influencer, you can provide ROI by demonstrating your ability to increase sales for brands.

To find and market yourself to United States brands, research what brands are already doing in terms of marketing. This will show you what brands are currently trending and help you identify which brands you want to work with.

Brands want to know that you can deliver results for them. Showcase your experience with other brands in your portfolio, and provide evidence of how your marketing efforts have generated sales for them.

Lastly, help United States brands understand the nuances of marketing in South Africa, so they feel comfortable working with you.


## 💬 How Do WhatsApp Influencers in South Africa Work?

WhatsApp influencers work in similar ways that other influencers work. They showcase products or services to their audiences and encourage their audiences to purchase the products or services.

But how do WhatsApp influencers work their magic?

1. **Brand Awareness**: WhatsApp influencers introduce their audiences to brands. They help build brand awareness through their messaging and marketing strategies. 

2. **Authenticity**: WhatsApp influencers build rapport with their audiences. They communicate and engage with their audiences regularly, which helps build their credibility. 

3. **Brand Loyalty**: WhatsApp influencers help create brand loyalty. Once they have established a product or service with their audience, their audience is likely to return to that influencer when they are looking to purchase similar products or services. 

4. **Conversations**: WhatsApp is a platform for conversation. Influencers can directly message their audiences and have two-way conversations with them. This further builds rapport and trust between influencers and their audiences. 

5. **WOM Marketing**: Word-of-mouth marketing is one of the most powerful ways to get others to purchase products or services. WhatsApp influencers utilize WOM marketing by sharing their personal experiences with products or services. When audiences hear positive things about products from trusted people, they are more likely to purchase those products. 

6. **Messages**: WhatsApp influencers can share different types of messages with their audiences, including text, images, audio, video, and documents. They can share product demonstrations and tutorials, provide links for purchasing products that audiences can click on, and answer any questions audiences may have about products. 

7. **Groups**: WhatsApp influencers can create groups that audiences can join. This allows a WhatsApp influencer to create a community of followers who are interested in what that influencer shares. WhatsApp influencers can also partner with brands to create brand-centric groups where audiences can learn more about brands and their products and services. 

8. **Broadcast Lists**: WhatsApp influencers can create lists of contacts to send out messages to audiences. They can send messages about important updates or promotional offers that audiences may be interested in. 

9. **Status Updates**: Similar to stories on Instagram and Facebook, WhatsApp influencers can share status updates with their audiences. Status updates only last for 24 hours, but influencers can keep their audiences engaged by regularly providing updates about products and services. 

10. **Links**: WhatsApp influencers can include links in their messages. This allows them to direct audiences to brands’ websites or social media pages, where audiences can learn more about products or services and make purchases. 

11. **Easy Communication**: WhatsApp influencers can engage with their audiences directly. If an audience member has a question about a product, they can directly message the influencer to get an answer. This personal touch goes a long way for audiences.
