## üé¨ Why brands should choose YouTube influencers

### 1. **Higher Return on Investment (ROI) than television**

YouTube influencer advertising has better ROI than traditional media like television.

Unlike television ads, which viewers can skip by changing channels or using a remote, viewers must watch YouTube ads to receive content.

As a result, YouTube ads are 10 times more effective than TV ads.

YouTube influencers build trust with their audiences, leading to higher conversion rates than TV ads. Over 90% of YouTube users trust influencer reviews.

### 2. **Good audience engagement**

YouTube influencers can engage their audiences better than other types of advertising.

People spend an average of 11 hours every week watching video content. YouTube videos receive more engagement than any other type of media.

In fact, YouTube videos receive 1 billion likes every day, and viewers leave almost 400 million comments on videos every day.

YouTube has better audience engagement than TV. Audiences spend more time watching content on YouTube than watching television.

### 3. **Wide audience reach**

YouTube is popular across the globe. There are more than 2 billion YouTube users.

YouTube reaches more adults than any other social media platform or broadcast TV net.

YouTube can reach more than 90% of internet users aged 18 to 34 years. In fact, 80% of 13- to 24-year-olds in the world access YouTube at least once a month.

Brands can tap into new markets and reach global audiences through YouTube influencer marketing.


## üé§ How to find YouTube influencers in the UAE

### 1. **Use influencer marketing platforms**

The easiest way to find YouTube influencers in the UAE is to use an influencer marketing platform.

These platforms connect brands to influencers while managing marketing campaigns.

Influencer marketing platforms allow brands to find influencers by location, audience size, niche, and other factors. Brands can view influencers' profiles with their audience demographics, engagement metrics, and pricing.

Some of the leading influencer marketing platforms include:

- **BaoLiba**:  BaoLiba is a leading global influencer marketing platform with 100 support sites across different countries. Brands can find influencers, celebrities, and content creators to promote their products in Dubai and other cities in the UAE.
- **Influencity**: Influencity is an influencer management platform that connects brands with YouTube influencers across the world. Brands can analyze influencers' audiences and metrics to identify the right creators for their campaigns.
- **Upfluence**: Upfluence is a comprehensive influencer marketing platform that helps brands find and collaborate with YouTube creators. Brands can search for influencers by niche, location, audience size, and content type.


### 2. **Search on YouTube**

Brands can also use YouTube's search feature to find UAE influencers directly.

Brands must search for relevant keywords about their products or services to find influencers in their niches.

For example, brands can search for the keywords "Dubai Best Restaurants" to find food influencers based in Dubai.

Keywords to search may include:

- The products or services being promoted
- Locations where the products or services are sold
- The audience demographics targeted by the campaign

Brands can also add "vlogger" or "influencer" to their search terms to find relevant influencers faster.

Here is an example of searching for a make-up influencer in Dubai:

### 3. **Check social media**

When you have identified a list of potential influencers, check their social media profiles.

Brands should view influencers' profiles on other social media platforms to see their audience engagement metrics.

If a YouTube influencer has a strong presence on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, they are ideal for your advertising campaign.

### 4. **Look for testimonials and reviews**

Brands should also look for testimonials and reviews from other brands about potential influencers. 

If other brands have worked with an influencer before, they will often leave feedback online about their experience.

Brands can find testimonials and reviews on the influencer's website or social media pages. Influencer marketing platforms may also provide testimonials from brands that have worked with influencers featured on their platforms. 

### 5. **Create a list of potential YouTube influencers**

Once a brand has researched the right influencers to promote their products on YouTube, they should compile a shortlist of their top picks.

### 6. **Contact the right influencers**

The final step is to contact the shortlisted influencers to start the collaboration process.

Brands should contact the influencers directly or reach out to their management agencies. Brands should provide all the necessary details about their products and the marketing campaign to potential influencers.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to be aware of when hiring YouTube influencers in the UAE

### 1. **Fake influencers**

Some YouTube influencers may inflate their audience numbers with fake subscribers and viewers. Brands can waste money and not get any value from their marketing campaigns when working with fake influencers.

There are several warning signs of fake influencers. These include:

- Sudden increases in an influencer's audience metrics. Brands should be wary of influencers whose audience numbers spike overnight.
- Brands can check influencers' audience engagement metrics. Most fake influencers have low audience engagement rates compared to average creators.
- Brands can use third-party tools to verify influencers' audience metrics and demographics. 

### 2. **Fake reviews**

Some YouTube influencers may also post fake reviews about products. An influencer may praise a product in the video yet their testimonial does not match its description.

Brands should ask influencers to share a script of the video before they publish it. This way, brands can verify that influencers are being honest and truthful in their reviews.

### 3. **Untrustworthiness**

Some influencers are not trustworthy and may fail to deliver on their commitments. Brands should look for trustworthy influencers who have a proven track record of being reliable.

### 4. **Contractual agreements**

Brands should ensure that all agreements with influencers are in writing. Contracts protect both parties in case something goes wrong.

Contracts should outline the agreed terms and deliverables, such as deadlines and payment details.


## üöÄ Conclusion

UAE YouTube influencer marketing is a worthwhile strategy for helping brands gain more customers. 

As long as brands know the prevailing rates and how to find trustworthy influencers, they can run successful marketing campaigns.
