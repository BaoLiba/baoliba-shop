Vietnam is home to some of the world’s best brands and products. From trendy fashion labels to sophisticated tech companies, there are a ton of Vietnam brands that are poised to skyrocket their success in 2025.

To help them thrive, Vietnam brands are looking for local influencers to partner with. The best place to find these influencers with millions of followers is through Messenger.

Here’s how Vietnam brands can find influencers for Messenger marketing campaigns in 2025.

## 📱 Why Messenger Influencer Marketing for Vietnam Brands?

Social media currently rules marketing strategies, with influencer marketing being the hottest trend. Influencer marketing leverages the popularity of social media personalities to promote products and brands to their huge audiences.

Though influencer marketing appears to be all about Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, the real MVP of social media marketing is Messenger. Messenger influencer marketing is when social media influencers primarily promote products and brands through Messenger.

Messenger is one of the most powerful marketing tools at any business’ disposal. With over 1 billion users worldwide, Messenger has more users than any other social media platform. However, only 6% of marketers currently use Messenger for marketing.

Messenger influencer marketing is a form of influencer marketing that is still in its infancy. This provides a unique opportunity for any brand to get ahead of the game by leveraging Messenger influencers before it becomes mainstream.

## 💪 Why Messenger Influencers Are the Best

Messenger influencers are some of the most effective social media personalities in the game. Here’s why Messenger influencers will be your best bet if you want to boost your Vietnam brand’s marketing campaigns and conversions in 2025.

### 🤝 They Drive Conversations

Messenger influencers are experts at driving conversations. They have the unique ability to persuade their audience to message them directly and ask questions about the products and brands they promote. This is a trait that other social media influencers can only dream of.

A Messenger influencer’s primary goal is to drive conversations. Whether it’s about a new fashion brand or a trendy restaurant, Messenger influencers are amazing at enticing their audience to hit them up and continue the conversation away from the public eye.

### ✨ They are More Authentic

Unlike traditional and social media, Messenger is far more personal and less superficial. Messenger influencers leverage this intimacy to build rapport with their audience and create lasting relationships with them.

With a Messenger influencer, the promotion of your Vietnam brand is more genuine, authentic, and realistic. Your Vietnam brand will come off as more trustworthy and credible as a result.

### 💸 They Convert Leads Better

Because Messenger is a more intimate and personal space, leads generated through Messenger are much warmer than leads generated through traditional social media. Messenger influencers are more capable of converting leads into customers.

In fact, Messenger has a staggering 10%-80% conversion rate! This is significantly higher than the conversion rates of traditional social media and email marketing.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 They Have Smaller, More Engaged Audiences

Messenger influencers have relatively smaller audiences than traditional social media influencers. This means that they can dedicate more time to building relationships with their audience and helping them with their needs.

As a result, Messenger influencers have considerably more engaged audiences. Their followers engage more with their content and convert better than those of traditional social media influencers.

### ⏰ They are Quicker

Messenger is the fastest form of communication. It’s quicker than voice calls, video calls, and emails. Because of this, Messenger influencers can build relationships and convert leads faster than their social media counterparts.

Messenger influencers are more accessible and responsive. When someone messages a Messenger influencer about a product or brand, they’re likely to get a reply in less than 30 minutes. This personal touch can mean the difference between a sale and a lost opportunity.
