WhatsApp has established itself as a significant component of everyday life in South Africa, serving as a platform for both personal interactions and professional exchanges. 

It‚Äôs known for its end-to-end encryption and user-friendliness. WhatsApp has outperformed its competitors in South Africa, boasting an impressive 23 million daily users. Given the current state of the platform, it is not surprising that many say it‚Äôs the best platform for influencer marketing in South Africa.

According to the 2023 Instagram Trends Report by Meta, 51% of Instagram users in South Africa said they were more likely to engage with businesses through messaging apps like WhatsApp than traditional social media platforms.

This trend is a wake-up call for brands who have largely focused their influencer marketing efforts on Facebook and Instagram.

So, how do South African brands find the right WhatsApp influencers to reach their target market through WhatsApp? 


## üìä WhatsApp Influencers in South Africa

Influencers on WhatsApp differ from those on conventional platforms in terms of reach and style. WhatsApp influencers typically have less reach than regular social media influencers, but they make up for it with the trust they have built with their close connections and community. 

Many WhatsApp influencers have about 200-500 contacts, just like regular users. However, most of them have also established themselves as authority figures in their respective niches, meaning that most of their contacts regard them as trusted sources of information.

The difference in influencer style on WhatsApp is reflected in how they present themselves. Unlike Instagram influencers who rely on high-resolution photos and flashy captions to attract followers, WhatsApp influencers focus on sharing valuable content that resonates with their close contacts. 

WhatsApp influencers build their reputation through the recommendations they make for products and services that they believe in. 


## üí° How to Find WhatsApp Influencers in South Africa

Finding WhatsApp influencers is not as straightforward as searching for Facebook or Instagram influencers. This is due to WhatsApp's emphasis on privacy over a large online presence.

However, here are some tried-and-tested ways that brands can use to find the right WhatsApp influencers for their South African influencer marketing campaigns.

### 1. Collaborate with an Influencer Marketing Agency

The simplest and quickest way to find WhatsApp influencers is to partner with an influencer marketing agency. These agencies have extensive networks of influencers covering various niches and audiences, including WhatsApp influencers. 

Influencer marketing agencies can connect brands with WhatsApp influencers who have access to their target markets and are suitable for their specific campaigns. 

Some notable influencer marketing agencies in South Africa include:

* **CleverClicks** ‚Äì A specialist digital marketing agency that also includes influencer marketing as part of their services.

* **BUZZAROUND** ‚Äì An influencer marketing agency that covers a wide range of platforms, including WhatsApp.

* **Influence.co** ‚Äì An influencer marketplace that connects brands and influencers. They have a range of influencer types, including WhatsApp influencers.

### 2. Use WhatsApp to Discover WhatsApp Influencers

If you are looking for a more hands-on approach to finding WhatsApp influencers, you can simply use WhatsApp itself to find them. 

While there is no search function on WhatsApp, there are several creative ways to use the app to discover WhatsApp influencers. 

For starters, you can ask around in your circles to find out if anyone knows any WhatsApp influencers. If you work with any other influencers or social media personalities, ask them if they know any WhatsApp influencers. 

You can also ask your followers or customers if they know any WhatsApp influencers.

Another way to find WhatsApp influencers is to join relevant groups on WhatsApp. For example, if you are looking for WhatsApp influencers in the fashion niche, you can join fashion groups on WhatsApp. 

These groups often contain several members who are fashion enthusiasts, and some may even be fashion influencers. 

You can also join WhatsApp groups that contain influencers from a variety of niches. These groups provide a great opportunity to network and connect with WhatsApp influencers. 

One way to find WhatsApp groups is to join Facebook groups that are dedicated to sharing WhatsApp group links. Joining these Facebook groups will open you to many WhatsApp group links that you can join.

### 3. Search Google for WhatsApp Influencers Lists

Another way to find WhatsApp influencers is to search Google for lists of WhatsApp influencers. 

There are several articles online that contain lists of WhatsApp influencers. Some of these articles are specific to South Africa, while others are global.

For example, you can find a list of WhatsApp influencers in South Africa on the website of **Sabrina G**.

However, it‚Äôs important to note that some of the WhatsApp influencers listed in these articles may no longer be active. Others may not be suitable for your campaign. 

Be sure to verify the influencers before contacting them.

### 4. Find WhatsApp Influencers on Instagram

While Instagram is not the same as WhatsApp, there are many influencers on Instagram who also use WhatsApp as a platform to communicate with followers and customers. 

Many Instagram influencers include their WhatsApp numbers in their bios, so you can directly reach out to them.

However, Instagram influencers often have a larger following compared to WhatsApp influencers. This means that they might not have the same level of closeness with their audience as WhatsApp influencers and therefore might not be as trusted by their contacts. 

Nonetheless, you can still find a number of WhatsApp influencers on Instagram.

To find WhatsApp influencers on Instagram, you can do the following:

* Go to Instagram and enter the hashtag #WhatsAppInfluencer into the search bar. You will see a number of Instagram posts from influencers who have advertised their WhatsApp numbers using this hashtag.

* You can also enter the hashtag #DMForWhatsApp into the search bar. Many influencers who have not included their WhatsApp numbers in their bios use this hashtag to indicate to their followers that they can reach them on WhatsApp by direct messaging them. 

### 5. Visit Influencer Marketing Platforms

Influencer marketing platforms are online marketplaces that connect brands with influencers. These platforms allow brands to search for influencers based on various criteria, including their niche, location, audience size, and platform. 

Some influencer marketing platforms allow brands to specifically look for WhatsApp influencers. 

Some of the popular influencer marketing platforms include:

* **AspireIQ** ‚Äì An influencer marketing platform that connects brands with influencers, including WhatsApp influencers.

* **Traackr** ‚Äì An influencer marketing platform that provides brands with tools to discover and manage influencers, including WhatsApp influencers.

* **Influencity** ‚Äì An influencer marketing platform that offers brands a range of tools to find and work with influencers, including WhatsApp influencers.

### 6. Use Hashtags to Search for WhatsApp Influencers

Similar to Instagram, WhatsApp influencers also use hashtags on WhatsApp to promote their profiles and make them discoverable. 

While hashtags are not clickable on WhatsApp, you can still use them to search for WhatsApp influencers. 

To find WhatsApp influencers using hashtags, you can do the following:

* Go to Google and enter the search query ‚ÄúWhatsApp influencer‚Äù along with a hashtag, such as #WhatsAppInfluencers or #WhatsAppInfluencer. You will see several results from articles and websites that contain lists of WhatsApp influencers. You can then go through the lists to find influencers to work with.

* You can also do the same search query on Twitter or Instagram to find WhatsApp influencers.

### 7. Find WhatsApp Influencers on YouTube

YouTube is another platform where many influencers share their WhatsApp numbers and promote themselves as WhatsApp influencers. 

To find WhatsApp influencers on YouTube, you can search for the keywords ‚ÄúWhatsApp influencer‚Äù in the search bar. You will find a number of videos from influencers who have shared their WhatsApp numbers. 

However, just like with Instagram, many of the influencers on YouTube who advertise their WhatsApp numbers might not have as much influence on WhatsApp as they do on YouTube. 


## ‚ùó Working with WhatsApp Influencers in South Africa

When working with WhatsApp influencers in South Africa, brands should keep in mind that WhatsApp is a more intimate platform compared to other social media platforms. 

WhatsApp influencers connect closely with their contacts, and intrusive marketing tactics might damage their relationship with their followers. 

Brands should therefore allow WhatsApp influencers the freedom to promote their products and services in their own way. 

This may mean that brands will not have as much control over how products and services are represented as they would with traditional influencers.

Moreover, brands should ensure that they only work with WhatsApp influencers who align with their values and target markets. 


## üì¢ Conclusion

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in South Africa, which makes it an excellent platform for influencer marketing. 

However, finding WhatsApp influencers is not as straightforward as finding regular social media influencers. Because WhatsApp is a more private platform, brands will need to use different methods to find the right WhatsApp influencers for their campaigns.
