TikTok has a reputation for high advertising costs, and this has made many Nigerian brands opt for Likee marketing campaigns instead.

According to Gao, a Lagos-based digital marketing agency, costs for TikTok ad placements can go as high as ‚Ç¶500,000 ($648) for top video placements. In contrast, Nigerian influencers on Likee may charge as low as ‚Ç¶85,000 ($110) for similar campaigns.
