With influencer marketing booming, Australia brands are more than ever eager to team up with social media influencers to help elevate their brands. 

While social media influencers have long been synonymous with platforms like TikTok and Instagram, LinkedIn influencers are now establishing their presence as key players in the influencer marketing industry. 

Influencers on LinkedIn are uniquely positioned to harness the platform's professional atmosphere to build credibility and develop authentic partnerships with brands.

LinkedIn influencers have the added bonus of being able to showcase their expertise to an audience of like-minded business professionals, which in turn presents brands with valuable opportunities to collaborate and leverage the influencer's credibility.

As brands look to build their presence on LinkedIn, they are increasingly looking to influencers to help them achieve their goals.

### What is Influencer Marketing on LinkedIn?

A LinkedIn influencer is someone who has a strong online presence and a significant following on LinkedIn. Influencer marketing is when brands partner with these influencers to promote their products or services.

According to Hubspot, 61% of marketers plan to increase their influencer marketing budget over the next year, and nearly 50% say influencer marketing is their fastest-growing channel.

Not only do brands see great returns from influencer marketing, but consumers trust influencer recommendations nine times more than traditional advertising.

In fact, data shows that 9 in 10 consumers say they would be more likely to engage with a brand or buy a product if they were featured in user-generated content.

LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional network. With over 875 million users in more than 200 countries worldwide, LinkedIn is a powerful platform for connecting with business professionals, including executives and decision-makers from top brands.

Because of this, LinkedIn influencers are perfectly positioned to partner with brands looking to reach a professional audience through influential voices within their industry.

### Why LinkedIn Influencers are in Demand Among Australia Brands

What sets LinkedIn apart from other social media platforms is its unique audience. LinkedIn is the only platform where you can reach purely professionals. 

While Instagram and TikTok have their fair share of business professionals, these platforms also cater to a more casual audience, which can dilute a brand's marketing efforts.

Because LinkedIn has a more serious tone, LinkedIn influencers have an increased credibility among their audience. 

According to LinkedIn's own research, 79% of executives say they are influenced by peer recommendations when making purchasing decisions. This means that LinkedIn influencers have a direct line to key decision-makers within brands.

Brands can leverage this credibility by partnering with LinkedIn influencers to help promote their products or services. Influencer marketing has been shown to increase brand awareness and sales, and LinkedIn influencers are no exception.

### How to Identify LinkedIn Influencers in Australia

To find LinkedIn influencers in Australia, brands should look for professionals who are actively engaged on the platform and have a significant following. 

There are several tools and platforms available that can help brands identify LinkedIn influencers in their industry.

Some key indicators to look for in a LinkedIn influencer include:

- **Strong following:** Look for LinkedIn influencers who have a large number of followers. A LinkedIn influencer should have at least 500 connections, but the best influencers usually have thousands of followers. 

- **Engagement:** Check the number of likes, comments, and shares their posts receive. Influencers with high engagement rates are more likely to have their message seen by their audience. 

- **Industry relevance:** Look for influencers who are relevant to your industry. For example, if you're in the tech industry, look for LinkedIn influencers who are tech industry professionals. 

- **Authority:** LinkedIn has a built-in authority scoring system that ranks users based on their activity, connections, and engagement. Look for influencers who have a high authority score.

### Where to Find LinkedIn Influencers in Australia

There are several platforms specifically designed to help brands find LinkedIn influencers, including:

- **LinkedIn:** The best place to start looking for influencers is on LinkedIn itself. Use the search function to find professionals in your industry. 

- **BuzzSumo:** BuzzSumo is an influencer marketing platform that allows brands to search for influencers by keyword, topic, or domain. 

- **Upfluence:** Upfluence is an influencer marketing platform that offers a database of influencers across various social media platforms, including LinkedIn. 

- **Klear:** Klear is another influencer marketing platform that offers a database of influencers across multiple social media platforms, including LinkedIn.

#### Tips for Working with LinkedIn Influencers in Australia

Once you have identified potential LinkedIn influencers to partner with, the next step is reaching out to them. Here are some tips for reaching out to LinkedIn influencers in Australia:

1. **Personalize your message:** Avoid sending generic messages to influencers. Instead, personalize your message by mentioning something specific about their work or how you came across their profile. 

2. **Be clear and concise:** When reaching out to influencers, be clear and concise about your proposal. Let them know what you're offering and how it will benefit them. 

3. **Follow up:** If you don't hear back from an influencer after your initial message, don't be afraid to follow up. Influencers receive a lot of messages, so your message may have simply gotten lost in the shuffle.

4. **Be flexible:** Be willing to negotiate the terms of the collaboration. Influencers have their own rates and terms, so be open to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.

5. **Be professional:** Treat influencers as professionals and be respectful in all communications. Influencers are more likely to work with brands that treat them professionally.

6. **Be transparent:** Be upfront about what you expect from the collaboration and what the influencer can expect in return. Transparency builds trust and makes for a more successful partnership.

#### How Much Should You Pay LinkedIn Influencers in Australia?

When it comes to paying LinkedIn influencers, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. 

Influencer rates depend on various factors, including their audience size, engagement rates, and the scope of the collaboration. 

According to the 2023 LinkedIn Influencer Marketing Report from Word of Mouth, LinkedIn influencers charge an average of $8,855 per post. 

However, LinkedIn influencers with a smaller audience may charge less, while those with a larger audience may charge more. 

In addition to cash payments, many influencers are also open to receiving free products or services in exchange for promoting a brand.

Using influencer marketing to promote your brand on LinkedIn can be a highly effective marketing strategy.
