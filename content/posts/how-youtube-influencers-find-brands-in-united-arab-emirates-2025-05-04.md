UAE's influencer marketing industry is booming, and YouTube influencers are at the forefront of collaboration with major UAE brands. 

In their quest to engage consumers and find potential brand partners,  YouTube influencers are keenly aware of the digital landscape in the UAE, particularly the social media habits of UAE residents. 

This article examines what YouTube influencers need to do to find potential UAE brand partnerships in 2025.

## üéØ Capitalize on UAE YouTube Trends

YouTube is a powerful social media platform in the UAE, where 2.78 million users are active. 

UAE residents spend an average of 22.6 hours per month watching videos on YouTube. 

YouTube is the second most popular social media platform in the UAE, with 76% of residents using it. The UAE is ranked as one of the countries with the highest average daily time spent on YouTube in the world, with each user watching an average of 67 minutes daily. 

In 2025, the most subscribed YouTube channels in the UAE are expected to be owned by popular content creators, including Mo Vlogs, 3M views, Ali Al Sayed, and Anas Bukhash.

In 2025, a YouTube Short campaign will be a prerequisite for YouTube influencers who hope to collaborate with UAE brands.

## üí∏ Understand UAE Influencer Marketing Regulations and Payment Methods

The influencer marketing industry in the UAE is heavily regulated. 

The National Media Council requires influencers to fill out a registration form and undergo training before being approved to begin their influencer marketing activities. 

Also, a new law regulating advertising in the UAE that was enacted on January 1, 2025, stipulates that influencers must declare their advertising partnerships in their content.

These regulations impose heavy penalties on influencers who fail to comply. For example, the NMC recently imposed a hefty fine of AED 100,000 against a high-profile influencer who failed to declare advertising partnerships in their content.

UAE brands are also aware of these regulations and will often prefer to partner with influencers who are compliant.

In addition to being aware of the regulatory landscape, YouTube influencers must also familiarize themselves with popular payment methods in the UAE. 

The most popular payment methods in the UAE are:

1. **Cash** ‚Äì Cash remains the most preferred mode of payment in the UAE, especially for small businesses.

4. **Digital Wallet** ‚Äì Digital wallets, including PayPal, Google Wallet, and Apple Pay, are popular payment methods among UAE residents, especially the youth. 
5. **Cryptocurrency** ‚Äì Cryptocurrency payments are becoming more common in the UAE. 

Most UAE brands will prefer to make payments through established payment methods such as bank transfers, PayPal, and Google Wallet. 

Additionally, UAE brands may offer non-monetary compensation such as gifts, products, and services in exchange for collaborations.

## üåç Leverage UAE-Specific Social Media Platforms 

YouTube influencers can also find UAE brand collaboration opportunities on UAE-specific social media platforms. 

For example, **Grape Vine** is a UAE-based influencer and marketing agency that specializes in helping brands identify and partner with influencers.

Founded in 2019, the agency has over 40,000 influencers on its roster. 

Grape Vine provides influencers with opportunities to collaborate with brands such as Mamas and Papas, Cigna, and UAE University. 

The agency uses data-driven decision-making to match influencers with brands based on their engagement and audience demographics, ensuring that brands effectively reach their target markets.
