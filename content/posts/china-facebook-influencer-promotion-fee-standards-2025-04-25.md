## ‚ùó What marketing collaboration pricing should South African brands be alert of?
Because of how niche influencer marketing is, Chinese influencers on Facebook have exclusive rights to dictate their marketing collaboration prices and negotiate their own terms.

That being said, here are some of the pricing models that South African brands should look out for when negotiating marketing deals with Chinese influencers on Facebook. 

### ‚öñÔ∏è Flat fee pricing
This is the most common pricing model used in influencer marketing. In this agreement, the influencer sets a fixed price for their services. Usually, it covers just one deliverable post, for example, five Instagram stories or one Facebook post.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Cost per hour pricing
In this model, brands pay influencers by the hour. This pricing model is favored by Chinese influencers on Facebook who have made a living out of their influencer careers.

### üìä Cost per click pricing
Brands only pay influencers once someone clicks on their links. While this cost structure is often frowned upon in traditional advertising, it can be a boon for Chinese Facebook influencers that have a high level of engagement.

### üéØ Cost per acquisition pricing
Brands only pay influencers for completed actions such as sales or leads. This pricing structure is common in influencer marketing, however, it is also rare to see it work as influencers prefer fixed pricing. 


## üí° Negotiation tips for brands
The distinct niche that influencer marketing is means every campaign is unique. Here are some negotiation tips for South African brands when looking to collaborate with Chinese influencers on Facebook.

### 1. Do research on the influencer
Researching the influencer should be step one in the negotiation process. Brands must know who the influencer is and what their content is about. 

Brands should know the influencer‚Äôs audience demographics and engagement rates to ensure that the influencer is the right fit for the brand.

### 2. Know what you want
What does the brand want from the collaboration? Increased sales or leads or more brand awareness? Being clear about what the brand wants from the campaign helps to ensure that the collaboration produces the desired results.

### 3. Create a win-win situation
There‚Äôs a famous saying that nothing is free in this world. Brands should approach influencer collaborations as a mutually beneficial partnership. 

This means creating a win-win partnership where influencers not only gain from the collaboration, but they also feel they were compensated adequately. 

### 4. Don‚Äôt be afraid to walk away
If a Chinese influencer‚Äôs expectations are way out of line with the brand‚Äôs marketing budget, it‚Äôs simple: walk away. 

Brands should never agree to an influencer‚Äôs pricing if their expectations are way out of line with the brand's budget. 


## üõçÔ∏è How Chinese influencers on Facebook drive more sales
South African brands should collaborate with Chinese influencers on Facebook to tap into their large consumer base. 

Chinese Facebook influencers should be South African brands‚Äô go-to marketing partners to promote their products and services to Chinese consumers. 

Here‚Äôs how:

### ü•∑ Chinese consumers are loyal
If they enjoy a brand, they will remain loyal to it regardless of what happens in the market.

That is why Chinese influencers on Facebook are highly effective to market products to Chinese consumers. If they promote a product, it shows their audience that they love it. 

This win-win situation creates a partnership that fosters brand loyalty amongst their followers. 

### üèÜ Chinese consumers love luxury 
Although many Chinese consumers are conscious of their spending, they do not shy away from spending money on luxury products or services when they shop.

That is why South African brands must pay attention to the rates Chinese influencers on Facebook ask for. Their steep prices should not deter brands from collaborating with them. 


## üõë Challenges of partnering with Chinese influencers on Facebook
Brands must be aware of the challenges that may arise when collaborating with Facebook influencers from China.

### 1. Influencer marketing takes time
Although influencer marketing campaigns can be effective in driving quick results, they can also take time to produce the desired results. 

Brands must be patient and allow the collaboration process to occur.

### 2. Competition is fierce
Collaborating with a Chinese influencer on Facebook is a privilege that not many brands can afford. This means that particular Chinese influencers may have many brands seeking to collaborate with them.

Brands must be prepared to negotiate and even compromise to secure a lucrative influencer marketing deal. 

### 3. Invest in the collaboration
Although partnering with Chinese influencers on Facebook can seem expensive, brands must be prepared to invest in the collaboration. 

Although some brands may see steep influencer prices as an expense, they must look at the collaboration as an investment into their business.

If done correctly, influencer marketing can produce high returns on investment.


## üé§ Influencers vs Celebrities
Although celebrities can offer brands a lot of exposure, that does not mean they are better than influencers. Here are some reasons why Chinese influencers on Facebook can outperform South African celebrities.


### 1. Better engagement
Although celebrities tend to have a massive following, influencers often have a higher level of engagement with their followers. 

This means their posts are more likely to generate clicks, likes, shares, and comments compared to a celebrity‚Äôs post.

### 2. Niche audiences
Influencers cater to niche audiences. This means they have a better understanding of what their audience wants. 

As a result of this understanding, they have more influence over their audience. This is great news for South African brands seeking to market their products to Chinese consumers through influencer collaborations. 

### 3. Authenticity
Consumers are tired of traditional advertising methods and celebrity endorsements. 

Influencers are trusted sources of information, unlike celebrities, who are often seen as self-promoting.

## üì¢ Conclusion
From the exploration of how and why Chinese Facebook influencers on Facebook will continue  to command high prices for marketing collaborations, it‚Äôs clear that they offer South African brands a unique opportunity to reach Chinese consumers.
