With the recent changes to the LinkedIn algorithm, influencer marketing is set to grow significantly in 2025. South African LinkedIn influencers are shifting their focus to brands outside the continent, with French brands being at the top of the list of brands they want to collaborate with. 

But how can you get a French brand‚Äôs attention? How can you convince them that you are worth the investment? Keep reading to find out how South African LinkedIn influencers can collaborate with French brands.

## ü§î Why French Brands?

The French are known for their love of quality. They are very discerning consumers who prefer quality over quantity. 

In South Africa, LinkedIn influencers have built a reputation for producing quality content that resonates with audiences. They have invested time and effort into building their brands, and as a result, they have developed a loyal following. 

French brands value this kind of loyalty and quality, which makes South African influencers prime candidates for collaboration. 

## üìä The Future of Influencer Marketing on LinkedIn 

According to a report by Statista in 2022, LinkedIn is now the preferred social media platform for influencer marketing, overtaking both Instagram and Facebook. This is in part due to LinkedIn‚Äôs extensive professional network and its consistent growth over the last two decades.

22% of marketers globally agree that LinkedIn is the most effective social media platform for influencer marketing, with 43% of marketers based in the Americas saying the same. 

As more marketers move to LinkedIn, there is a good chance that the 2025 report will see a significant increase in effective influencer marketing on the platform. 

## üíº Establish Your Authority

As mentioned previously, LinkedIn is the preferred social media platform for B2B marketing. This means that companies on LinkedIn are generally looking for partners that can help them grow their businesses.

When approaching a French brand for collaboration, it is imperative that you establish yourself as an authority in your niche. This can be done through regularly engaging with your audience and providing them with high-quality content.

You can also do this by participating in industry-related discussions and by sharing insights that showcase your expertise. 

## üí∞ Leverage Your Competitive Advantage

South Africa has a reputation for producing some of the best talent globally. Many of the South Africans who have made it big internationally are in industries that are considered creative or artistic.

The French appreciate the arts and they have a long history of patronizing artists. This is an advantage that South African LinkedIn influencers can leverage when approaching French brands for collaboration.

By positioning yourself as a creative, you can appeal to the French sensibility and convince them that you can help them achieve their business objectives creatively. 

## üîç Research Brands to Target

Before you reach out to brands for collaboration, it is important that you do some research into the brands that you will be targeting. 

You need to ensure that you are targeting brands that are relevant to your niche as this increases your chances of being accepted for collaboration. 

You should take the time to familiarize yourself with the brand culture and their communications strategy. This will help you tailor your approach to the specific needs of the brand, which will increase the chances of you being accepted. 

## üìù Prepare Your Proposal

Once you have found a few brands that you would like to collaborate with, you will need to prepare a proposal. 

Your proposal should include the following sections:
- **Talent Introduction:** Introduce yourself and provide a brief overview of your experience and expertise.
- **Collaboration Concept:** Outline your proposed collaboration concept and how it aligns with the brand‚Äôs objectives.
- **Audience Insights:** Provide insights into your audience demographics and engagement rates, highlighting how your audience aligns with the brand‚Äôs target market.
- **Creative Approach:** Explain your creative approach to the collaboration and how it will resonate with the audience.
- **Benefits to the Brand:** Clearly articulate the benefits the brand can expect from the collaboration, including increased visibility, engagement, and potential conversions.
- **Call to Action:** End with a strong call to action that encourages the brand to reach out for further discussions. 

## üìû Reach Out to the Decision-Makers

Often in big businesses, the people who manage their social media accounts are not the decision-makers. This means that you may need to reach out to other departments to have your proposal accepted.

To make this easier, you can use tools like Hunter.io to search for emails associated with the brand‚Äôs domain name. You can also use these tools, which include Voila Norbert, FindThatLead, and Contact Out, to verify the emails that you find. 

When reaching out to decision-makers, it is important that you use a professional email address. A professional email address will be your name followed by the domain name of your website. 

If you do not have a website, it is advisable that you acquire one. A website is an essential tool for an influencer as it serves as a portfolio, a hub for content, and an additional channel for engagement. 

## üåç Use a Global Influencer Marketing Platform

Influencer marketing platforms allow influencers to create profiles that brands can browse when searching for influencers to collaborate with. 

The profiles usually include metrics and insights that provide the brands with the information they need to make a decision about the collaboration. 

Using an influencer marketing platform can save you time and effort when reaching out to brands. You will also have access to a larger pool of brands, which increases your chances of finding a collaboration that aligns with your objectives. 

One of the leading influencer marketing platforms is BaoLiba. BaoLiba is a global influencer marketing platform that specializes in connecting influencers in emerging markets with brands in developed markets.

## üì∞ Keep Up to Date With Industry Trends

The world is constantly changing, and it is essential that you keep up to date with industry trends and changes. This includes changes to social media algorithms, influencer marketing trends, and changes to the platforms that brands use to find influencers for collaboration. 

LinkedIn has a feature that allows you to follow hashtags that are relevant to your industry. You should take advantage of this feature to ensure that you stay ahead of the game and remain relevant. 

## ‚ùó Conclusion

If you are a South African LinkedIn influencer looking to collaborate with French brands in 2025, it is important that you establish your authority and leverage your competitive advantages.
