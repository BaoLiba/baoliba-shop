These statistics show that LinkedIn is a great place for influencers to showcase their prowess in the South African influencer marketing landscape.

## üòØ Why target Indian brands?

India is a major player on the world stage and is projected to become the world‚Äôs largest economy by 2025.

It is also a major destination for South African exports. 

In a recent report, the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition confirmed, "India has consistently been one of South Africa's top trading partners over the past decade.¬†

Total trade between South Africa and India increased from R56 billion (2020) to R70 billion (2021) and R97 billion (2022)".

With this level of trade activity, it is only wise to tap into the Indian market for influencer marketing campaigns.

## üì¢ Why LinkedIn?

Unlike Instagram, where influencers have to dance and lip-sync to stay relevant, LinkedIn allows influencers to showcase their professionalism.

LinkedIn is a professional social media platform, meaning that it attracts a more serious crowd than Instagram.

This is especially important when targeting Indian brands because they are more likely to respond positively to a more serious approach.

### 1. Showcase your expertise

The best way to market yourself to Indian brands is to showcase your expertise and thought leadership.

Share valuable content that can help Indian brands understand the South African market and how to navigate it.

For example, share articles about the best times to visit South Africa or what tourists should avoid.

### 2. Share case studies

Another way to attract the attention of Indian brands is to share case studies that highlight successful marketing campaigns you have executed.

For example, you can showcase one of your previous influencer marketing campaigns that delivered exceptional results.

### 3. Leverage your network

Another way to attract the attention of Indian brands is to leverage your network. 

If you know anyone who works for an Indian brand, ask them to refer you to their marketing department.

If you do not know anyone, leverage mutual connections to get an introduction.

This can be done by checking your connections on LinkedIn to see if anyone is connected to someone who works for an Indian brand.

## üìä Local influencers in India

According to a report published in eMarketer, ‚ÄúIndia ranks second in the world in terms of active social media users. 

The number of social media users in India is expected to reach more than 500 million by 2025.‚Äù
