Pinterest is a visual social media platform that is fast becoming a great way for brands to market their businesses. 

With the projected growth of the influencer marketing industry reaching new heights in the next few years, Pinterest influencers are poised to be at the forefront of brand marketing strategies.

The platform has been noted for having a higher conversion rate than any social media channel and has a unique audience that is highly engaged, making it a gold mine for influencer marketing.

Unlike Instagram, Pinterest is focused on the pinning and sharing of idea-oriented and niche-specific content that really captures the attention of users and keeps them coming back for more.

This means that Pinterest influencers can create content that is tailored to their niche, making it more likely to connect with brands in their industry. 

Pinterest influencers can find South Korean brands to collaborate with by using the right influencer marketing tools and strategies.


## üé¨ What Makes Pinterest Influencers Stand Out?

Pinterest influencers are an entirely different breed of influencer, in that they create their following through evergreen content that captures the attention of those who are searching for that specific type of content.

This means that Pinterest influencers can create content that is tailored to their niche, making it more likely to connect with brands in their industry.

In fact, according to Pinterest research, 90% of Pinterest users are on the platform to find new brands or products, compared to only 48% of Instagram users. 

Additionally, 83% of Pinterest users say they are more likely to purchase a product after seeing it on Pinterest, compared to only 50% of Instagram users. 

This means that Pinterest influencers can have a greater impact on their audience than influencers on other platforms.


## üì¢ Why Collaborate with South Korean Brands?

According to the Korea International Trade Association (KITA), the country's exports of beauty products to the U.S. have surged over the past year.

The rise of K-Beauty shows that South Korean beauty brands will continue to explore marketing avenues like influencer marketing on Pinterest to reach more customers.

One of the most notable K-Beauty brands is The Saem, which has been known to send South African beauty influencers PR packages to promote their products on social media. 

They also have a Pinterest account where they post a myriad of stunning beauty looks created using their products.

Another popular South Korean brand is Innisfree, which operates several stores in South Africa and has made a name for itself as one of the most trusted beauty brands in the country.

## ‚ùó Pinterest Influencer Marketing Pitfalls

Despite Pinterest influencer marketing being a great way for brands to reach their target audience, there are still some pitfalls that brands should avoid.

- **Inauthenticity:** Pinterest users have a keen eye for spotting fake or inauthentic accounts. Brands should ensure that influencers they work with are genuine in their content and audience engagement or they risk being called out for working with a fake influencer.

- **Poor Engagement:** The point of working with an influencer is to tap into their audience and have them buy your product or check out your website. If an influencer's audience isn't engaged or genuinely interested in what they post about, they are unlikely to act on their recommendations. Brands should check that influencers they work with have an engaged audience.

- **Unrealistic Expectations:** Influencer marketing can be a long-term investment. Brands should understand that it can take time to see results from influencer marketing, and they should not expect instant success overnight. Brands should set realistic goals and expectations when working with influencers.

- **Not Having a Clear Strategy:** Brands should have a clear influencer marketing strategy before reaching out to influencers. This includes defining their target audience, setting goals, and determining the type of content they want influencers to create. Without a clear strategy, brands risk wasting time and resources on influencer marketing.
