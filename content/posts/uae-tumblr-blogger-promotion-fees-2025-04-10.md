The UAE is a promising market for South African brands looking to expand their horizons through influencer marketing. Tumblr is a lesser-known platform than Instagram or TikTok, but it can still be a great asset for brands looking to target audiences that spend most of their time there. 

Partnering with influencers on Tumblr can be more cost-effective than on other social media platforms, but brands need to know how much to budget for that. 

Here‚Äôs what brands can expect to pay influencers for their marketing campaigns in the UAE.

## üì¢ Influencer Marketing in the UAE

UAE residents make up about 88% of Tumblr's traffic, making the site a perfect place for brands looking to market their products to them. 

Brands can use Tumblr to create buzz around their products and services before launching them in the UAE.  

They can also engage audiences directly for market research, lead generation, and customer support.

Additionally, Tumblr is a great platform for brands with a visual identity. Those in the fashion, hospitality, and entertainment industries can rely on Tumblr to showcase their brand‚Äôs aesthetic. 

## üí∏ Tumblr Influencer Charges in UAE

Brands looking to work with influencers in the UAE should be ready to pay anywhere from AED 500 to AED 5,000 ($136 ‚Äì $1,366) per post. 

Micro-influencers with a following ranging from 1,000 to 50,000 tend to charge the lowest rates, while those with over 50,000 followers can charge higher fees. 

Some influencers choose to work on a commission basis for sales made through personalized links or promo codes. 

For South African brands paying influencers, they must also consider transaction fees charged by foreign exchange service providers. 

## ‚ùó Payment Options for Influencer Marketing in the UAE

There are several ways brands can pay influencers for their services in the UAE. 

Bank wire transfers are the most common way. Other popular payment methods include Paypal, Payoneer, and Fiverr. 

South African brands can also use Remitly and Western Union to process payments to the UAE.

Both Remitly and Western Union have a strong reputation for reliability and speed, but they also have higher fees than other payment platforms. 

## üìä Factors Affecting Influencer Marketing Prices in UAE

There are many factors that determine how much influencers charge to promote brands. 

Here are some of the most common pricing standards used to set rates:

### 1. Influence and Reach

The number of followers an influencer has can significantly affect the rates they charge for a sponsored post. 

Influencers with a large following generally command higher fees due to their extensive reach and ability to influence a larger audience.

### 2. Engagement Rate

Influencers with a highly engaged audience can charge higher rates than those with a large but less engaged following. 

Brands looking to partner with influencers should assess their engagement rate, including the number of likes, shares, and comments their posts receive. 

### 3. Content Quality

The quality of an influencer's content, including images, videos, and messaging, can also impact their rates. 

Influencers who consistently produce high-quality content may charge higher fees due to their expertise and creativity. 

### 4. Niche and Specialization

Influencers who specialize in specific niches, such as beauty, travel, food, or fitness, may charge more for their services due to their unique expertise and targeted audience. 

Brands looking to promote products in these niches may be willing to pay more to work with a specialized influencer.

### 5. Campaign Scope

The scope of the influencer marketing campaign can also affect pricing. 

Brands that require multiple posts, stories, or videos may need to budget more to compensate influencers for their time and effort. 

### 6. Exclusivity and Rights

Brands that want exclusivity in their market or the rights to reuse influencer content for their own marketing purposes may need to pay higher fees. 

### 7. Seasonality

Prices can also fluctuate based on seasonal demand. Influencers may charge higher rates during peak seasons, such as holidays or special events when brands are more likely to invest in advertising. 

## üìà Future Projections for Influencer Marketing in UAE

The influencer marketing industry in the UAE has seen significant growth in recent years and is projected to continue expanding.
